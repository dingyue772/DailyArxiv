| **[Why Language Models Hallucinate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AraHalluEval: A Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation Framework for Arabic LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04656v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

| **[Can LLMs Lie? Investigation beyond Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03518v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics, shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in high-stakes environments.

| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learned Hallucination Detection in Black-Box LLMs using Token-level Entropy Production Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04492v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering (QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection, specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top <10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on annual reports from an industrial dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 1 table. pre-print version</p></details> |
| **[Exploring and Mitigating Fawning Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00869v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniDPO: A Preference Optimization Framework to Address Omni-Modal Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00723v1)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information. By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities. All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Causes, Not One: Rethinking Omission and Fabrication Hallucinations in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00371v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances, yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods, based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications. In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination mitigation strategies.</p></details> | Preprint,Underreview |
| **[ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21496v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing accuracy and hallucination of LLMs in Alzheimer's disease research through knowledge graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21238v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations, limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding Memories: An Efficient Pipeline for Self-Consistency Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21228v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |
| **[GLSim: Detecting Object Hallucinations in LVLMs via Global-Local Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19972v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucinating with AI: AI Psychosis as Distributed Delusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19588v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is much discussion of the false outputs that generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok create. In popular terminology, these have been dubbed AI hallucinations. However, deeming these AI outputs hallucinations is controversial, with many claiming this is a metaphorical misnomer. Nevertheless, in this paper, I argue that when viewed through the lens of distributed cognition theory, we can better see the dynamic and troubling ways in which inaccurate beliefs, distorted memories and self-narratives, and delusional thinking can emerge through human-AI interactions; examples of which are popularly being referred to as cases of AI psychosis. In such cases, I suggest we move away from thinking about how an AI system might hallucinate at us, by generating false outputs, to thinking about how, when we routinely rely on generative AI to help us think, remember, and narrate, we can come to hallucinate with AI. This can happen when AI introduces errors into the distributed cognitive process, but it can also happen when AI sustains, affirms, and elaborates on our own delusional thinking and self-narratives, such as in the case of Jaswant Singh Chail. I also examine how the conversational style of chatbots can lead them to play a dual-function, both as a cognitive artefact and a quasi-Other with whom we co-construct our beliefs, narratives, and our realities. It is this dual function, I suggest, that makes generative AI an unusual, and particularly seductive, case of distributed cognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding the Ungrounded: A Spectral-Graph Framework for Quantifying Hallucinations in multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19366v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Detection of Hallucinated Entities in Long-Form Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03531v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates, citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks, indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Detection of Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Multiple Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18473v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Being Kind Isn't Always Being Safe: Diagnosing Affective Hallucination in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16921v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emotionally sensitive interactions, where their simulated empathy can create the illusion of genuine relational connection. We define this risk as Affective Hallucination, the production of emotionally immersive responses that foster illusory social presence despite the model's lack of affective capacity. To systematically diagnose and mitigate this risk, we introduce AHaBench, a benchmark of 500 mental health-related prompts with expert-informed reference responses, evaluated along three dimensions: Emotional Enmeshment, Illusion of Presence, and Fostering Overdependence. We further release AHaPairs, a 5K-instance preference dataset enabling Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for alignment with emotionally responsible behavior. Experiments across multiple model families show that DPO fine-tuning substantially reduces affective hallucination without degrading core reasoning and knowledge performance. Human-model agreement analyses confirm that AHaBench reliably captures affective hallucination, validating it as an effective diagnostic tool. This work establishes affective hallucination as a distinct safety concern and provides practical resources for developing LLMs that are not only factually reliable but also psychologically safe. AHaBench and AHaPairs are accessible via https://huggingface.co/datasets/o0oMiNGo0o/AHaBench, and code for fine-tuning and evaluation are in https://github.com/0oOMiNGOo0/AHaBench. Warning: This paper contains examples of mental health-related language that may be emotionally distressing.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[QueryBandits for Hallucination Mitigation: Exploiting Semantic Features for No-Regret Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16697v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused higher hallucination prevalence; yet most mitigation work focuses on after-the-fact filtering rather than shaping the queries that trigger them. We introduce QueryBandits, a bandit framework that designs rewrite strategies to maximize a reward model, that encapsulates hallucination propensity based upon the sensitivities of 17 linguistic features of the input query-and therefore, proactively steer LLMs away from generating hallucinations. Across 13 diverse QA benchmarks and 1,050 lexically perturbed queries per dataset, our top contextual QueryBandit (Thompson Sampling) achieves an 87.5% win rate over a no-rewrite baseline and also outperforms zero-shot static prompting ("paraphrase" or "expand") by 42.6% and 60.3% respectively. Therefore, we empirically substantiate the effectiveness of QueryBandits in mitigating hallucination via the intervention that takes the form of a query rewrite. Interestingly, certain static prompting strategies, which constitute a considerable number of current query rewriting literature, have a higher cumulative regret than the no-rewrite baseline, signifying that static rewrites can worsen hallucination. Moreover, we discover that the converged per-arm regression feature weight vectors substantiate that there is no single rewrite strategy optimal for all queries. In this context, guided rewriting via exploiting semantic features with QueryBandits can induce significant shifts in output behavior through forward-pass mechanisms, bypassing the need for retraining or gradient-based adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, using only data and convex optimization tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML, existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.</p></details> |  |

The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. Conventional droop-based methods remain prevalent due to their simplicity, yet their design is largely empirical and conservative, lacking rigorous guarantees. Advanced strategies improve certain aspects, but often sacrifice scalability, robustness, or formal safety. In this work, we propose a Distributed Safety-Critical Controller (DSCC) that systematically integrates global stabilization with formal safety guarantees in a fully decentralized manner. Leveraging control barrier functions and the port-Hamiltonian system theory, the DSCC achieves scalable safe stabilization while preserving real-time implementability. High-fidelity switched-circuit simulations validate the controller's advantages under various contingencies. This framework paves the way for resilient, safety-critical, and scalable control in next-generation DC microgrids.</p></details> |  |

Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800, whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC) battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, EVS38, https://evs38-program.org/en/evs-38-proceedings/all</p></details> |
| **[Parallel-Constraint Model Predictive Control: Exploiting Parallel Computation for Improving Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03261v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.</p></details> |  |

We propose a streaming, source-free test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent) with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 page paper, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Scaling behavior of large language models in emotional safety classification across sizes and tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04512v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs. borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance, particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings. However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller, on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Resilience of Quadrotors in Underground Environments by Combining Learning-based and Safety Controllers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02808v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations, and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to `out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety of the safety controller (avoiding collision).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and awarded best paper at the 11th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT 2025 - https://codit2025.org/)</p></details> |

Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end. This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 tables |
| **[Enhancing Reliability in LLM-Integrated Robotic Systems: A Unified Approach to Security and Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02163v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments, remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling, state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The framework is open-sourced with simulation and physical deployment demos at https://llmeyesim.vercel.app/</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Thread-Safety Analysis of Java Classes with CodeQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02022v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In object-oriented languages software developers rely on thread-safe classes to implement concurrent applications. However, determining whether a class is thread-safe is a challenging task. This paper presents a highly scalable method to analyze thread-safety in Java classes. We provide a definition of thread-safety for Java classes founded on the correctness principle of the Java memory model, data race freedom. We devise a set of properties for Java classes that are proven to ensure thread-safety. We encode these properties in the static analysis tool CodeQL to automatically analyze Java source code. We perform an evaluation on the top 1000 GitHub repositories. The evaluation comprises 3632865 Java classes; with 1992 classes annotated as @ThreadSafe from 71 repositories. These repositories include highly popular software such as Apache Flink (24.6k stars), Facebook Fresco (17.1k stars), PrestoDB (16.2k starts), and gRPC (11.6k starts). Our queries detected thousands of thread-safety errors. The running time of our queries is below 2 minutes for repositories up to 200k lines of code, 20k methods, 6000 fields, and 1200 classes. We have submitted a selection of detected concurrency errors as PRs, and developers positively reacted to these PRs. We have submitted our CodeQL queries to the main CodeQL repository, and they are currently in the process of becoming available as part of GitHub actions. The results demonstrate the applicability and scalability of our method to analyze thread-safety in real-world code bases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oyster-I: Beyond Refusal -- Constructive Safety Alignment for Responsible Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01909v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report Code & Model weights available: https://github.com/Alibaba-AAIG/Oyster</p></details> |
| **[Predicting NCAP Safety Ratings: An Analysis of Vehicle Characteristics and ADAS Features Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01897v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically. This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight, Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately 5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV. Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics, specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability, contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model. However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Under review</p></details> |
| **[Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%. Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Strata-Sword: A Hierarchical Safety Evaluation towards LLMs based on Reasoning Complexity of Jailbreak Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01444v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread recognition for their superior comprehension and have been deployed across numerous domains. Building on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) ideology, Large Reasoning models (LRMs) further exhibit strong reasoning skills, enabling them to infer user intent more accurately and respond appropriately. However, both LLMs and LRMs face the potential safety risks under jailbreak attacks, which raise concerns about their safety capabilities. Current safety evaluation methods often focus on the content dimensions, or simply aggregate different attack methods, lacking consideration of the complexity. In fact, instructions of different complexity can reflect the different safety capabilities of the model: simple instructions can reflect the basic values of the model, while complex instructions can reflect the model's ability to deal with deeper safety risks. Therefore, a comprehensive benchmark needs to be established to evaluate the safety performance of the model in the face of instructions of varying complexity, which can provide a better understanding of the safety boundaries of the LLMs. Thus, this paper first quantifies "Reasoning Complexity" as an evaluable safety dimension and categorizes 15 jailbreak attack methods into three different levels according to the reasoning complexity, establishing a hierarchical Chinese-English jailbreak safety benchmark for systematically evaluating the safety performance of LLMs. Meanwhile, to fully utilize unique language characteristics, we first propose some Chinese jailbreak attack methods, including the Chinese Character Disassembly attack, Lantern Riddle attack, and Acrostic Poem attack. A series of experiments indicate that current LLMs and LRMs show different safety boundaries under different reasoning complexity, which provides a new perspective to develop safer LLMs and LRMs.</p></details> |  |

While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, plenty of current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous year results while also considering bicyclist safety.</p></details> |  |
