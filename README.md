| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in LM-Based TTS Models via Distribution Alignment Using GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15442v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Energy: Detecting LLM Hallucination Beyond Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14496v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEPTH: Hallucination-Free Relation Extraction via Dependency-Aware Sentence Simplification and Two-tiered Hierarchical Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs, DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence, correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-knowledge LLM hallucination detection and mitigation through fine-grained cross-model consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14314v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucinations in medical devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14118v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer methods in medical devices are frequently imperfect and are known to produce errors in clinical or diagnostic tasks. However, when deep learning and data-based approaches yield output that exhibit errors, the devices are frequently said to hallucinate. Drawing from theoretical developments and empirical studies in multiple medical device areas, we introduce a practical and universal definition that denotes hallucinations as a type of error that is plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to evaluation methodologies and discuss existing approaches for minimizing the prevalence of hallucinations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[EGOILLUSION: Benchmarking Hallucinations in Egocentric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12687v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates. Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models via Causal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12495v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical inconsistencies in LLM outputs.

| **[Hallucination in LLM-Based Code Generation: An Automotive Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11257v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating code generation tasks offering new opportunities across software engineering domains. However, their practical application remains limited due to hallucinations - outputs that appear plausible but are factually incorrect, unverifiable or nonsensical. This paper investigates hallucination phenomena in the context of code generation with a specific focus on the automotive domain. A case study is presented that evaluates multiple code LLMs for three different prompting complexities ranging from a minimal one-liner prompt to a prompt with Covesa Vehicle Signal Specifications (VSS) as additional context and finally to a prompt with an additional code skeleton. The evaluation reveals a high frequency of syntax violations, invalid reference errors and API knowledge conflicts in state-of-the-art models GPT-4.1, Codex and GPT-4o. Among the evaluated models, only GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o were able to produce a correct solution when given the most context-rich prompt. Simpler prompting strategies failed to yield a working result, even after multiple refinement iterations. These findings highlight the need for effective mitigation techniques to ensure the safe and reliable use of LLM generated code, especially in safety-critical domains such as automotive software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRFD: Multi-Region Fusion Decoding with Self-Consistency for Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10264v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Response Semantic Divergence Metrics for Faithfulness Hallucination and Misalignment Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10192v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual, nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors, {confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score, $\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors. These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous, confident confabulation.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SHALE: A Scalable Benchmark for Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09584v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness hallucination at a rather coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks often rely on costly manual curation or reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs, we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and 6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios. Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination vs interpretation: rethinking accuracy and precision in AI-assisted data extraction for knowledge synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09458v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge syntheses (literature reviews) are essential to health professions education (HPE), consolidating findings to advance theory and practice. However, they are labor-intensive, especially during data extraction. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted extraction promises efficiency but raises concerns about accuracy, making it critical to distinguish AI 'hallucinations' (fabricated content) from legitimate interpretive differences. We developed an extraction platform using large language models (LLMs) to automate data extraction and compared AI to human responses across 187 publications and 17 extraction questions from a published scoping review. AI-human, human-human, and AI-AI consistencies were measured using interrater reliability (categorical) and thematic similarity ratings (open-ended). Errors were identified by comparing extracted responses to source publications. AI was highly consistent with humans for concrete, explicitly stated questions (e.g., title, aims) and lower for questions requiring subjective interpretation or absent in text (e.g., Kirkpatrick's outcomes, study rationale). Human-human consistency was not higher than AI-human and showed the same question-dependent variability. Discordant AI-human responses (769/3179 = 24.2%) were mostly due to interpretive differences (18.3%); AI inaccuracies were rare (1.51%), while humans were nearly three times more likely to state inaccuracies (4.37%). Findings suggest AI variability depends more on interpretability than hallucination. Repeating AI extraction can identify interpretive complexity or ambiguity, refining processes before human review. AI can be a transparent, trustworthy partner in knowledge synthesis, though caution is needed to preserve critical human insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucinations in Code Change to Natural Language Generation: Prevalence and Evaluation of Detection Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08661v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Causal Effect of Social Bias on Faithfulness Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07753v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to faithfulness hallucinations, where the output does not align with the input. In this study, we investigate whether social bias contributes to these hallucinations, a causal relationship that has not been explored. A key challenge is controlling confounders within the context, which complicates the isolation of causality between bias states and hallucinations. To address this, we utilize the Structural Causal Model (SCM) to establish and validate the causality and design bias interventions to control confounders. In addition, we develop the Bias Intervention Dataset (BID), which includes various social biases, enabling precise measurement of causal effects. Experiments on mainstream LLMs reveal that biases are significant causes of faithfulness hallucinations, and the effect of each bias state differs in direction. We further analyze the scope of these causal effects across various models, specifically focusing on unfairness hallucinations, which are primarily targeted by social bias, revealing the subtle yet significant causal effect of bias on hallucination generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025 (Full Paper)</p></details> |
| **[Trustworthy Medical Imaging with Large Language Models: A Study of Hallucinations Across Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07031v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However, these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT, or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEVADE: Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Analysis with Decoupled Evaluation for Hallucination-Resistant Irony Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06803v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm detection is a crucial yet challenging Natural Language Processing task. Existing Large Language Model methods are often limited by single-perspective analysis, static reasoning pathways, and a susceptibility to hallucination when processing complex ironic rhetoric, which impacts their accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose **SEVADE**, a novel **S**elf-**Ev**olving multi-agent **A**nalysis framework with **D**ecoupled **E**valuation for hallucination-resistant sarcasm detection. The core of our framework is a Dynamic Agentive Reasoning Engine (DARE), which utilizes a team of specialized agents grounded in linguistic theory to perform a multifaceted deconstruction of the text and generate a structured reasoning chain. Subsequently, a separate lightweight rationale adjudicator (RA) performs the final classification based solely on this reasoning chain. This decoupled architecture is designed to mitigate the risk of hallucination by separating complex reasoning from the final judgment. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of **6.75%** in Accuracy and **6.29%** in Macro-F1 score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Generative AI-Driven Scaffolding: Reducing Hallucinations and Enhancing Quality in Self-Regulated Learning Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05929v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) holds a potential to advance existing educational technologies with capabilities to automatically generate personalised scaffolds that support students' self-regulated learning (SRL). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts' evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the "LLM-as-a-Judge" technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAITH: A Framework for Assessing Intrinsic Tabular Hallucinations in finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05201v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in finance. Accurate extraction and precise calculation from tabular data are essential for reliable financial analysis, since even minor numerical errors can undermine decision-making and regulatory compliance. Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on context-dependent, numerical, and proprietary tabular data that existing hallucination benchmarks rarely capture. In this study, we develop a rigorous and scalable framework for evaluating intrinsic hallucinations in financial LLMs, conceptualized as a context-aware masked span prediction task over real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel, automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust methodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Incident Response Planning Using a Lightweight Large Language Model with Reduced Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05188v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and effective incident response is key to managing the growing frequency of cyberattacks. However, identifying the right response actions for complex systems is a major technical challenge. A promising approach to mitigate this challenge is to use the security knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs) to assist security operators during incident handling. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of this approach, but current methods are mainly based on prompt engineering of frontier LLMs, which is costly and prone to hallucinations. We address these limitations by presenting a novel way to use an LLM for incident response planning with reduced hallucination. Our method includes three steps: fine-tuning, information retrieval, and lookahead planning. We prove that our method generates response plans with a bounded probability of hallucination and that this probability can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased planning time under certain assumptions. Moreover, we show that our method is lightweight and can run on commodity hardware. We evaluate our method on logs from incidents reported in the literature. The experimental results show that our method a) achieves up to 22% shorter recovery times than frontier LLMs and b) generalizes to a broad range of incident types and response actions.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural Language Generation (NLG) but remain susceptible to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading content. To address this, we explored methods both with and without external context, utilizing few-shot prompting with a LLM, token-level classification or LLM fine-tuned on synthetic data. Notably, our approaches achieved top rankings in Spanish and competitive placements in English and German. This work highlights the importance of integrating relevant context to mitigate hallucinations and demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned models and prompt engineering.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025, 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Dynamical Systems Framework for Reinforcement Learning Safety and Robustness Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15588v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty. Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that appear successful based on reward alone.</p></details> |  |

To this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However, existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains 23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yangyangyang127/SafetyFlow</p></details> |

| **[Adversarial Generation and Collaborative Evolution of Safety-Critical Scenarios for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14527v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows. Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently, Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, their safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of LRMs.</p></details> | 14pages, 3 figures |

SIL is typically determined based on the estimated Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD), which must remain within permissible limits to manage risk effectively. Extensive research has been conducted on determining target PFD and SIL, with a stronger emphasis on preventive SFs than on mitigation SFs. In this paper, we address a rather conceptual issue: we argue that PFD is not an appropriate reliability measure for mitigation SFs to begin with, and we propose an alternative approach that leverages the Probability Density Function (PDF) and the expected degree of failure as key metrics. The principles underlying this approach are explained and supported by detailed mathematical formulations. Furthermore, the practical application of this new methodology is illustrated through case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LinguaSafe: A Comprehensive Multilingual Safety Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12733v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models (LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity. The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety alignment. Our dataset and code are released to the public to facilitate further research in the field of multilingual LLM safety.</p></details> | 7pages, 5 figures |
| **[Rethinking Safety in LLM Fine-tuning: An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12531v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices, rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we reduce unsafe model responses from 16\% to approximately 5\%, as measured by keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets (Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIGN: Safety-Aware Image-Goal Navigation for Autonomous Drones via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12394v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-goal navigation (ImageNav) tasks a robot with autonomously exploring an unknown environment and reaching a location that visually matches a given target image. While prior works primarily study ImageNav for ground robots, enabling this capability for autonomous drones is substantially more challenging due to their need for high-frequency feedback control and global localization for stable flight. In this paper, we propose a novel sim-to-real framework that leverages visual reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve ImageNav for drones. To enhance visual representation ability, our approach trains the vision backbone with auxiliary tasks, including image perturbations and future transition prediction, which results in more effective policy training. The proposed algorithm enables end-to-end ImageNav with direct velocity control, eliminating the need for external localization. Furthermore, we integrate a depth-based safety module for real-time obstacle avoidance, allowing the drone to safely navigate in cluttered environments. Unlike most existing drone navigation methods that focus solely on reference tracking or obstacle avoidance, our framework supports comprehensive navigation behaviors--autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and image-goal seeking--without requiring explicit global mapping. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeCtrl: Region-Based Safety Control for Text-to-Image Diffusion via Detect-Then-Suppress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11904v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe, context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable direction for building more responsible generative models.</p></details> |  |

To inform future supports, we pursue a mixed-methods study of hybrid engineering design capstone teams' Psychological Safety (PS) (i.e., their climate of interpersonal risk-taking and mutual respect) to understand how the construct manifests in teams engaged in innovation. Using interviews, we study six teams' perceptions of PS indicators and how they present differently on Slack (when compared to in-person interactions). We then leverage the interview insights to design Slack-based PS indicators. We present five broad facets of PS in hybrid teams, four perceived differences of PS on Slack compared to in-person, and 15 Slack-based, PS indicators--the groundwork for future automated PS measurement on instant-messaging platforms. These insights produce three design implications and illustrative design examples for ways instant-messaging platforms can support Psychologically Safe hybrid teams, and best practices for hybrid teams to support interpersonal risk-taking and build mutual respect.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 9, No. 7</p></details> |
| **[Optimal CO2 storage management considering safety constraints in multi-stakeholder multi-site CCS projects: a game theoretic perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11618v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale, and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and unrealistic. In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2 into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control (E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.</p></details> | 38 pages, 16 figures |
| **[SafeConstellations: Steering LLM Safety to Reduce Over-Refusals Through Task-Specific Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11290v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation). Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[ORFuzz: Fuzzing the "Other Side" of LLM Safety -- Testing Over-Refusal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11222v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability. Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate, suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore, ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets. ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and trustworthy LLM-based software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Predictive Safety Filters on Humanoids: From Poisson Safety Functions to CBF Constrained MPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11129v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs). Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem. Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive safety-critical controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots</p></details> |
| **[Families' Vision of Generative AI Agents for Household Safety Against Digital and Physical Threats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11030v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As families face increasingly complex safety challenges in digital and physical environments, generative AI (GenAI) presents new opportunities to support household safety through multiple specialized AI agents. Through a two-phase qualitative study consisting of individual interviews and collaborative sessions with 13 parent-child dyads, we explored families' conceptualizations of GenAI and their envisioned use of AI agents in daily family life. Our findings reveal that families preferred to distribute safety-related support across multiple AI agents, each embodying a familiar caregiving role: a household manager coordinating routine tasks and mitigating risks such as digital fraud and home accidents; a private tutor providing personalized educational support, including safety education; and a family therapist offering emotional support to address sensitive safety issues such as cyberbullying and digital harassment. Families emphasized the need for agent-specific privacy boundaries, recognized generational differences in trust toward AI agents, and stressed the importance of maintaining open family communication alongside the assistance of AI agents. Based on these findings, we propose a multi-agent system design featuring four privacy-preserving principles: memory segregation, conversational consent, selective data sharing, and progressive memory management to help balance safety, privacy, and autonomy within family contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Pre-trained Vision Language Models Effective Construction Safety Inspectors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11011v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets, limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques, providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed framework, called gatekeeper, recursively guarantees the existence of an infinite-horizon trajectory that satisfies all constraints and system dynamics. Such trajectory is constructed using a backup controller, which we define formally in this paper. gatekeeper relies on a small number of verifiable assumptions, and is computationally efficient since it requires optimization over a single scalar variable. We make two primary contributions in this letter. (A) First, we develop the theory of gatekeeper: we derive a sub-optimality bound relative to a full nonlinear trajectory optimization problem, and show how this can be used in runtime to validate performance. This also informs the design of the backup controllers and sets. (B) Second, we demonstrate in detail an application of gatekeeper for multi-agent formation flight, where each Dubins agent must avoid multiple obstacles and weapons engagement zones, both of which are nonlinear, nonconvex constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.
