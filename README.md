| **[Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination: A Training Bias Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04567v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components, revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling (LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\% of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hacking Hallucinations of MLLMs with Causal Sufficiency and Necessity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04182v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination to Truth: A Review of Fact-Checking and Factuality Evaluation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03860v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and context-aware language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables.

| **[MultiRAG: A Knowledge-guided Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-source Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03553v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in https://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025 Research Paper</p></details> |
| **[SAVER: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Style-Aware Visual Early Revision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03177v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However, hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images, which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs' final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartCap: Mitigating Hallucination of Dense Chart Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03164v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |
| **[Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs, generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens, balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions. Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting its generalizability and efficacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual Probing for Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01862v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods, while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[A comprehensive taxonomy of hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01781v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation, ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes, categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cure or Poison? Embedding Instructions Visually Alters Hallucination in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01678v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance, increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly. Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[MAP: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Map-Level Attention Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01653v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of the map-level decoding strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIHBench: Benchmarking and Mitigating Multi-Image Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00726v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations, including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM25 has accepted this paper</p></details> |
| **[A Single Direction of Truth: An Observer Model's Linear Residual Probe Exposes and Steers Contextual Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23221v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context -- remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B). Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the 2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Hallucinations in Summarization via Reinforcement Learning with Entity Hallucination Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22744v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline, facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.</p></details> | 8 |
| **[Investigating Hallucination in Conversations for Low Resource Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22720v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as 'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.</p></details> |  |
| **[See Different, Think Better: Visual Variations Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22003v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces visual variation images with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/oliviadzy/ViHallu.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM MM25 |
| **[TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRAGE-Bench: LLM Agent is Hallucinating and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21017v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/mirage-bench.git</p></details> |

This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance.

| **[ReasoningGuard: Safeguarding Large Reasoning Models with Inference-time Safety Aha Moments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04204v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes. Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes. Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous, safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common exaggerated safety issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[HarmonyGuard: Toward Safety and Utility in Web Agents via Adaptive Policy Enhancement and Dual-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04010v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks. Our project is available here: https://github.com/YurunChen/HarmonyGuard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03864v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.</p></details> |  |

Despite its acknowledged significance, research on PS within the field of software engineering remains limited. The socio-technical complexities and fast-paced nature of software development present challenges to cultivating PS. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic secondary study has synthesized existing knowledge on PS in the context of software engineering. Objective: This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the existing body of knowledge on PS in software engineering. Specifically, it seeks to identify the potential antecedents and consequences associated with the presence or absence of PS among individuals involved in the software development process. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted, encompassing studies retrieved from four digital libraries. The extracted data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: The findings indicate a growing academic interest in PS within software engineering, with the majority of studies grounded in Edmondson's framework. Factors antecedents of PS were identified at the individual, team, and organizational levels, including team autonomy, agile methodologies, and leadership behaviors. Conclusion: PS fosters innovation, learning, and team performance within software development. However, significant gaps persist in understanding the contextual factors influencing PS, its underlying mechanisms, and effective strategies for its enhancement.

We propose a Force-Compliance Model Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots. FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS) method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Aware Imitation Learning via MPC-Guided Disturbance Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03129v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating improvements in both safety and task performance.

| **[PoseGuard: Pose-Guided Generation with Safety Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02476v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose-guided video generation has become a powerful tool in creative industries, exemplified by frameworks like Animate Anyone. However, conditioning generation on specific poses introduces serious risks, such as impersonation, privacy violations, and NSFW content creation. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{PoseGuard}$, a safety alignment framework for pose-guided generation. PoseGuard is designed to suppress unsafe generations by degrading output quality when encountering malicious poses, while maintaining high-fidelity outputs for benign inputs. We categorize unsafe poses into three representative types: discriminatory gestures such as kneeling or offensive salutes, sexually suggestive poses that lead to NSFW content, and poses imitating copyrighted celebrity movements. PoseGuard employs a dual-objective training strategy combining generation fidelity with safety alignment, and uses LoRA-based fine-tuning for efficient, parameter-light updates. To ensure adaptability to evolving threats, PoseGuard supports pose-specific LoRA fusion, enabling flexible and modular updates when new unsafe poses are identified. We further demonstrate the generalizability of PoseGuard to facial landmark-guided generation. Extensive experiments validate that PoseGuard effectively blocks unsafe generations, maintains generation quality for benign inputs, and remains robust against slight pose variations.</p></details> |  |

While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lessons Learned from the Real-World Deployment of Multi-Sensor Fusion for Proactive Work Zone Safety Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01599v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proactive safety systems that anticipate and mitigate traffic risks before incidents occur are increasingly recognized as essential for improving work zone safety. Unlike traditional reactive methods, these systems rely on real-time sensing, trajectory prediction, and intelligent infrastructure to detect potential hazards. Existing simulation-based studies often overlook, and real-world deployment studies rarely discuss the practical challenges associated with deploying such systems in operational settings, particularly those involving roadside infrastructure and multi-sensor integration and fusion. This study addresses that gap by presenting deployment insights and technical lessons learned from a real-world implementation of a multi-sensor safety system at an active bridge repair work zone along the N-2/US-75 corridor in Lincoln, Nebraska. The deployed system combines LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors with an edge computing platform to support multi-modal object tracking, trajectory fusion, and real-time analytics. Specifically, this study presents key lessons learned across three critical stages of deployment: (1) sensor selection and placement, (2) sensor calibration, system integration, and validation, and (3) sensor fusion. Additionally, we propose a predictive digital twin framework that leverages fused trajectory data for early conflict detection and real-time warning generation, enabling proactive safety interventions.</p></details> |  |

The idea is to prevent these issues from reaching end-users, ie, road users and inadvertently, pedestrians, aiming to potentially reduce accidents, and allow safe operation in dynamic attack surfaces, for the benefit of a host of stakeholders. This paper aims to bridge cybersecurity, safety, and privacy concerns in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) with respect to Risk Assessment (RA) and Threat Modelling (TM) altogether. Practitioners know the vast literature on this topic given the sheer number of recommendations, standards, best practices, and existing approaches, at times impairing projects and fostering valuable and actionable threat analysis. In this paper we collate key outcomes by highlighting latest standards and approaches in RA and TM research to tackle complex attack surfaces as the ones posed by automotive settings. We aim to provide the community with a list of approaches to align expectations with stakeholders when deciding where and when to focus threat related analysis in automotive solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Safety Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01151v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Human-Robot Red Teaming for Safety-Aware Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01129v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in safety-critical problem domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pro2Guard: Proactive Runtime Enforcement of LLM Agent Safety via Probabilistic Model Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00500v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities across domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation. However, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are difficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as AgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond only when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems lack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime enforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis. Pro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces. At runtime, it anticipates future risks by estimating the probability of reaching unsafe states, triggering interventions before violations occur when the predicted risk exceeds a user-defined threshold. By incorporating semantic validity checks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability while approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard extensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and autonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early on up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes (e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to 80.4% task completion. In autonomous driving scenarios, Pro2Guard achieves 100% prediction of traffic law violations and collisions, anticipating risks up to 38.66 seconds ahead.</p></details> |  |

However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/iSafety-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISION'25 - ICCV 2025 workshop</p></details> |
| **[R1-ACT: Efficient Reasoning Model Safety Alignment by Activating Safety Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00324v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on complex tasks, recent studies reveal that these models frequently fulfill harmful user instructions, raising significant safety concerns. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of LRM safety risks and find that models already possess sufficient safety knowledge but fail to activate it during reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose R1-Act, a simple and efficient post-training method that explicitly triggers safety knowledge through a structured reasoning process. R1-Act achieves strong safety improvements while preserving reasoning performance, outperforming prior alignment methods. Notably, it requires only 1,000 training examples and 90 minutes of training on a single RTX A6000 GPU. Extensive experiments across multiple LRM backbones and sizes demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and practical efficiency of our approach.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Integrating Opinion Dynamics into Safety Control for Decentralized Airplane Encounter Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00156v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the airspace becomes increasingly congested, decentralized conflict resolution methods for airplane encounters have become essential. While decentralized safety controllers can prevent dangerous midair collisions, they do not always ensure prompt conflict resolution. As a result, airplane progress may be blocked for extended periods in certain situations. To address this blocking phenomenon, this paper proposes integrating bio-inspired nonlinear opinion dynamics into the airplane safety control framework, thereby guaranteeing both safety and blocking-free resolution. In particular, opinion dynamics enable the safety controller to achieve collaborative decision-making for blocking resolution and facilitate rapid, safe coordination without relying on communication or preset rules. Extensive simulation results validate the improved flight efficiency and safety guarantees. This study provides practical insights into the design of autonomous controllers for airplanes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explanations for Unrealizability of Infinite-State Safety Shields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23603v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe Reinforcement Learning focuses on developing optimal policies while ensuring safety. A popular method to address such task is shielding, in which a correct-by-construction safety component is synthesized from logical specifications. Recently, shield synthesis has been extended to infinite-state domains, such as continuous environments. This makes shielding more applicable to realistic scenarios. However, often shields might be unrealizable because the specification is inconsistent (e.g., contradictory). In order to address this gap, we present a method to obtain simple unconditional and conditional explanations that witness unrealizability, which goes by temporal formula unrolling. In this paper, we show different variants of the technique and its applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Evaluation Benchmark for Medical LLMs: Illuminating Safety and Effectiveness in Clinical Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23486v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%), with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Synergistic Cognitive Biases to Bypass Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22564v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.</p></details> |  |
