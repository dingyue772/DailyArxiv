| **[Beyond Hallucinations: The Illusion of Understanding in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14665v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity. Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1 cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself (ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii) Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules. Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition, whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with human understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensembling Multiple Hallucination Detectors Trained on VLLM Internal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14330v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top entries on the final leaderboard.

| **[Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13080v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets, we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive vector steering: A training-free, layer-wise intervention for hallucination mitigation in large audio and multimodal models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12851v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Audio-Language Models and Multi-Modal Large Language Models have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as Audio Question Answering (AQA), Audio Captioning, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, there is growing evidence that these models can hallucinate about the content of the audio. To address this issue, we probe the models' internal states and propose Adaptive Vector Steering (AVS), a method that better grounds generation in audio content. We also identify a strong correlation between output correctness and internal representations. Experiments show consistent performance gains across two models and two benchmarks. On the Audio Hallucination QA dataset, our method boosts the F1-score of Gemma from 0.550 to 0.619 and Qwen from 0.626 to 0.632. Furthermore, our method increases the accuracy of Qwen on MMAU from 0.548 to 0.592, marking an 8% relative increase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply vector steering to mitigate hallucination in audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Note:...</summary><p>Note: This preprint is a version of the paper submitted to ICASSP 2026.

| **[Credal Transformer: A Principled Approach for Quantifying and Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12137v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer, which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions) instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution, representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a foundation for more reliable AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models: Foundations, Methodology, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12040v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for hallucination detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, magazine</p></details> |
| **[Multi-stage Prompt Refinement for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12032v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation, typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\% win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[CPR: Mitigating Large Language Model Hallucinations with Curative Prompt Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12029v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), 7 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination Detection via Internal States and Structured Reasoning Consistency in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11529v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states (Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning (Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable, fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

| **[Trustworthy Retrosynthesis: Eliminating Hallucinations with a Diverse Ensemble of Reaction Scorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10645v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. This approach formed the basis of our winning solution to the Standard Industries \$1 million Retrosynthesis Challenge. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Hallucinations in Authentic LLM-Human Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10539v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task. Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage. To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues, thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in 31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise, their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Images Speak Louder: Mitigating Language Bias-induced Hallucinations in VLMs through Cross-Modal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10466v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning via Functional Attention Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10285v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content. In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division: shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining. Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Functional-Attention-Control.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500 images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available: https://github.com/TruhnLab/VisionSemanticEntropy</p></details> |
| **[On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Hallucination Detection with Effective Rank-based Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08389v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers. Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules, thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and externally (different responses), providing a justification for using representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios, contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Mitigating Insertion Hallucination in Video-to-Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08078v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Hallucinations in Autonomous Vehicles: A Component-Agnostic Safety Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07749v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module, resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic. The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations, such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated, component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 15 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Semantics Tracing: A Framework for Explaining Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06107v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary contributions. First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic failures, we propose Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), a unified framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context (distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific commitment layer where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic associative pathway (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate, contextual pathway (akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks. Our framework's ability to quantify the coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation ($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the Transformer architecture.</p></details> |  |

| **[CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Further Results on Safety-Critical Stabilization of Force-Controlled Nonholonomic Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14931v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for force-controlled nonholonomic mobile robots under safety-critical constraints. We propose a continuous, time-invariant control law based on the gamma m-quadratic programming (gamma m-QP) framework, which unifies control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both stability and safety in the closed-loop system. For the first time, we construct a global, time-invariant, strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop nonholonomic mobile robot system with a nominal stabilization controller in polar coordinates; this strict Lyapunov function then serves as the CLF in the QP design. Next, by exploiting the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle dynamics, we develop a CBF for the mobile robot via an integrator backstepping procedure. Our main results guarantee both asymptotic stability and safety for the closed-loop system.

However, there remains a shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well. We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader range of well-grounded and practical criteria.</p></details> |  |
| **[Terrarium: Revisiting the Blackboard for Multi-Agent Safety, Privacy, and Security Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14312v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14301v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space. First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT, reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formalizing the Safety, Security, and Functional Properties of Agentic AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14133v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical, especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion, providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together, these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17 properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic, these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Belief Space Control of Safety-Critical Systems Under State-Dependent Measurement Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14100v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety-critical control is imperative for deploying autonomous systems in the real world. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer strong safety guarantees when accurate system and sensor models are available. However, widely used additive, fixed-noise models are not representative of complex sensor modalities with state-dependent error characteristics. Although CBFs have been designed to mitigate uncertainty using fixed worst-case bounds on measurement noise, this approach can lead to overly-conservative control. To solve this problem, we extend the Belief Control Barrier Function (BCBF) framework to accommodate state-dependent measurement noise via the Generalized Extended Kalman Filter (GEKF) algorithm, which models measurement noise as a linear function of the state. Using the original BCBF framework as baseline, we demonstrate the performance of the BCBF-GEKF approach through simulation results on a 1D single integrator setpoint tracking scenario and 2D unicycle kinematics trajectory tracking scenario. Our results confirm that the BCBF-GEKF approach offers less conservative control with greater safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint - Submitted to the 2026 American Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[International AI Safety Report 2025: First Key Update: Capabilities and Risk Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13653v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the publication of the first International AI Safety Report, AI capabilities have continued to improve across key domains. New training techniques that teach AI systems to reason step-by-step and inference-time enhancements have primarily driven these advances, rather than simply training larger models. As a result, general-purpose AI systems can solve more complex problems in a range of domains, from scientific research to software development. Their performance on benchmarks that measure performance in coding, mathematics, and answering expert-level science questions has continued to improve, though reliability challenges persist, with systems excelling on some tasks while failing completely on others. These capability improvements also have implications for multiple risks, including risks from biological weapons and cyber attacks. Finally, they pose new challenges for monitoring and controllability. This update examines how AI capabilities have improved since the first Report, then focuses on key risk areas where substantial new evidence warrants updated assessments.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Non-Clinical Induction in LLM Drug-Safety Decisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13931v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains, yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner, specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g., low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias: explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a paper accepted as a poster at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Generative AI for Health (GenAI4Health).

| **[SENTINEL: A Multi-Level Formal Framework for Safety Evaluation of LLM-based Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12985v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic, plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous methods and offering insights into their failure modes.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeMT: Multi-turn Safety for Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12133v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts; however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index (SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed guard models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An AI-Based Behavioral Health Safety Filter and Dataset for Identifying Mental Health Crises in Text-Based Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12083v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets: the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939, sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive (0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Text: 2943; Abstract: 256; Tables and Figures: 5</p></details> |
| **[Task-Specific Dual-Model Framework for Comprehensive Traffic Safety Video Description and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11907v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-based Safety Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11570v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses. The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense, such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series. Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

| **[AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.</p></details> | under review |
| **[DeepResearchGuard: Deep Research with Open-Domain Evaluation and Multi-Stage Guardrails for Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10994v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash, DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
