| **[Guarding against artificial intelligence--hallucinated citations: the case for full-text reference deposit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19848v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tendency of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems to "hallucinate" false information is well-known; AI-generated citations to non-existent sources have made their way into the reference lists of peer-reviewed publications. Here, I propose a solution to this problem, taking inspiration from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) data sharing guidelines, the clash of generative AI with the American judiciary, and the precedent set by submissions of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Journals should require authors to submit the full text of each cited source along with their manuscripts, thereby preventing authors from citing any material whose full text they cannot produce. This solution requires limited additional work on the part of authors or editors while effectively immunizing journals against hallucinated references.</p></details> | 3 pages |
| **[HausaNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Towards a Fine-Grained Model-Aware Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19650v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents our findings of the Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, MU-SHROOM, which focuses on identifying hallucinations and related overgeneration errors in large language models (LLMs). The shared task involves detecting specific text spans that constitute hallucinations in the outputs generated by LLMs in 14 languages. To address this task, we aim to provide a nuanced, model-aware understanding of hallucination occurrences and severity in English. We used natural language inference and fine-tuned a ModernBERT model using a synthetic dataset of 400 samples, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.032 and a correlation score of 0.422. These results indicate a moderately positive correlation between the model's confidence scores and the actual presence of hallucinations. The IoU score indicates that our model has a relatively low overlap between the predicted hallucination span and the truth annotation. The performance is unsurprising, given the intricate nature of hallucination detection. Hallucinations often manifest subtly, relying on context, making pinpointing their exact boundaries formidable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Hallucination of Large Multimodal Models in Video Understanding: Benchmark, Analysis and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19622v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hallucination of large multimodal models (LMMs), providing responses that appear correct but are actually incorrect, limits their reliability and applicability. This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%. The code and data are public at https://github.com/Hongcheng-Gao/HAVEN.</p></details> |  |
| **[KSHSeek: Data-Driven Approaches to Mitigating and Detecting Knowledge-Shortcut Hallucinations in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19482v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the development of natural language processing (NLP), especially in text generation tasks like question answering. However, model hallucinations remain a major challenge in natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their complex causes. We systematically expand on the causes of factual hallucinations from the perspective of knowledge shortcuts, analyzing hallucinations arising from correct and defect-free data and demonstrating that knowledge-shortcut hallucinations are prevalent in generative models. To mitigate this issue, we propose a high similarity pruning algorithm at the data preprocessing level to reduce spurious correlations in the data. Additionally, we design a specific detection method for knowledge-shortcut hallucinations to evaluate the effectiveness of our mitigation strategy. Experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces knowledge-shortcut hallucinations, particularly in fine-tuning tasks, without negatively impacting model performance in question answering. This work introduces a new paradigm for mitigating specific hallucination issues in generative models, enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18556v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success of Large Vision-Language models(LVLMs), these models still suffer hallucinations when describing images, generating answers that include non-existent objects. It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations. Our IAVA approach is available online at https://github.com/Lee-lab558/IAVA.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[ShED-HD: A Shannon Entropy Distribution Framework for Lightweight Hallucination Detection on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18242v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[FactSelfCheck: Fact-Level Black-Box Hallucination Detection for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17229v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only an 8% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Don't Fight Hallucinations, Use Them: Estimating Image Realism using NLI over Atomic Facts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15948v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the realism of images remains a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of De-Factify 4: 4nd Workshop on Multimodal Fact Checking and Hate Speech Detection, co-located with AAAI-2025</p></details> |

We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations in MLLMs via Multi-Frequency Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14895v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual-language tasks. However, the authenticity of the responses generated by MLLMs is often compromised by object hallucinations. We identify that a key cause of these hallucinations is the model's over-susceptibility to specific image frequency features in detecting objects. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Frequency Perturbations (MFP), a simple, cost-effective, and pluggable method that leverages both low-frequency and high-frequency features of images to perturb visual feature representations and explicitly suppress redundant frequency-domain features during inference, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates object hallucinations across various model architectures. Furthermore, as a training-time method, MFP can be combined with inference-time methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poly-FEVER: A Multilingual Fact Verification Benchmark for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16541v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), pose a significant challenge to the reliability of multilingual applications. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection focus primarily on English and a few widely spoken languages, lacking the breadth to assess inconsistencies in model performance across diverse linguistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce Poly-FEVER, a large-scale multilingual fact verification benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs. Poly-FEVER comprises 77,973 labeled factual claims spanning 11 languages, sourced from FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact. It provides the first large-scale dataset tailored for analyzing hallucination patterns across languages, enabling systematic evaluation of LLMs such as ChatGPT and the LLaMA series. Our analysis reveals how topic distribution and web resource availability influence hallucination frequency, uncovering language-specific biases that impact model accuracy. By offering a multilingual benchmark for fact verification, Poly-FEVER facilitates cross-linguistic comparisons of hallucination detection and contributes to the development of more reliable, language-inclusive AI systems. The dataset is publicly available to advance research in responsible AI, fact-checking methodologies, and multilingual NLP, promoting greater transparency and robustness in LLM performance. The proposed Poly-FEVER is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HanzhiZhang/Poly-FEVER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Verbal Uncertainty as a Linear Feature to Reduce Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14477v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs often adopt an assertive language style also when making false claims. Such ``overconfident hallucinations'' mislead users and erode trust. Achieving the ability to express in language the actual degree of uncertainty around a claim is therefore of great importance. We find that ``verbal uncertainty'' is governed by a single linear feature in the representation space of LLMs, and show that this has only moderate correlation with the actual ``semantic uncertainty'' of the model. We apply this insight and show that (1) the mismatch between semantic and verbal uncertainty is a better predictor of hallucinations than semantic uncertainty alone and (2) we can intervene on verbal uncertainty at inference time and reduce hallucinations on short-form answers, achieving an average relative reduction of 32%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From "Hallucination" to "Suture": Insights from Language Philosophy to Enhance Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14392v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores hallucination phenomena in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of language philosophy and psychoanalysis. By incorporating Lacan's concepts of the "chain of signifiers" and "suture points," we propose the Anchor-RAG framework as a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations. In contrast to the predominant reliance on trial-and-error experiments, constant adjustments of mathematical formulas, or resource-intensive methods that emphasize quantity over quality, our approach returns to the fundamental principles of linguistics to analyze the root causes of hallucinations in LLMs. Drawing from robust theoretical foundations, we derive algorithms and models that are not only effective in reducing hallucinations but also enhance LLM performance and improve output quality. This paper seeks to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding hallucinations in LLMs and aims to challenge the prevalent "guess-and-test" approach and rat race mentality in the field. We aspire to pave the way for a new era of interpretable LLMs, offering deeper insights into the inner workings of language-based AI systems.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[HDLCoRe: A Training-Free Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in LLM-Generated HDL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16528v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, when applied to hardware description languages (HDL), these models exhibit significant limitations due to data scarcity, resulting in hallucinations and incorrect code generation. To address these challenges, we propose HDLCoRe, a training-free framework that enhances LLMs' HDL generation capabilities through prompt engineering techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our approach consists of two main components: (1) an HDL-aware Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique with self-verification that classifies tasks by complexity and type, incorporates domain-specific knowledge, and guides LLMs through step-by-step self-simulation for error correction; and (2) a two-stage heterogeneous RAG system that addresses formatting inconsistencies through key component extraction and efficiently retrieves relevant HDL examples through sequential filtering and re-ranking. HDLCoRe eliminates the need for model fine-tuning while substantially improving LLMs' HDL generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance on the RTLLM2.0 benchmark, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving both syntactic and functional correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13107v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p></details> |  |

We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ARR - February 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG-KG-IL: A Multi-Agent Hybrid Framework for Reducing Hallucinations and Enhancing LLM Reasoning through RAG and Incremental Knowledge Graph Learning Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13514v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10941v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALURust: Exploiting Hallucinations of Large Language Models to Detect Vulnerabilities in Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10793v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an emerging programming language, Rust has rapidly gained popularity and recognition among developers due to its strong emphasis on safety. It employs a unique ownership system and safe concurrency practices to ensure robust safety. Despite these safeguards, security in Rust still presents challenges. Since 2018, 442 Rust-related vulnerabilities have been reported in real-world applications. The limited availability of data has resulted in existing vulnerability detection tools performing poorly in real-world scenarios, often failing to adapt to new and complex vulnerabilities. This paper introduces HALURust, a novel framework that leverages hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) to detect vulnerabilities in real-world Rust scenarios. HALURust leverages LLMs' strength in natural language generation by transforming code into detailed vulnerability analysis reports. The key innovation lies in prompting the LLM to always assume the presence of a vulnerability. If the code sample is vulnerable, the LLM provides an accurate analysis; if not, it generates a hallucinated report. By fine-tuning LLMs on these hallucinations, HALURust can effectively distinguish between vulnerable and non-vulnerable code samples. HALURust was evaluated on a dataset of 81 real-world vulnerabilities, covering 447 functions and 18,691 lines of code across 54 applications. It outperformed existing methods, achieving an F1 score of 77.3%, with over 10% improvement. The hallucinated report-based fine-tuning improved detection by 20\% compared to traditional code-based fine-tuning. Additionally, HALURust effectively adapted to unseen vulnerabilities and other programming languages, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[TruthPrInt: Mitigating LVLM Object Hallucination Via Latent Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10602v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major trustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TruthPrInt.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, the first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

| **[Judge Anything: MLLM as a Judge Across Any Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17489v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating generative foundation models on open-ended multimodal understanding (MMU) and generation (MMG) tasks across diverse modalities (e.g., images, audio, video) poses significant challenges due to the complexity of cross-modal interactions. To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing vision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends MLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two benchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the overall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any modality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG capabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries curated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates the judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from the perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a standardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in assessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting and 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges with MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and 30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and hallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated platform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models. Our work highlights the need for fairer evaluation protocols and stronger alignment with human preferences. The source code and dataset are publicly available at: https://urrealhero.github.io/judgeanythingweb/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address this issue, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM equipped with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms. The global VPP overlays learnable, axis-like embeddings onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues. The local VPP focuses on fine-grained localization by incorporating position-aware queries, which suggests probable object locations. We also introduce a VPP-SFT dataset with 0.6M samples, consolidating high-quality visual grounding data into a compact format for efficient model training. Training on this dataset with VPP enhances the model's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard grounding benchmarks despite using fewer training samples compared to other MLLMs like MiniGPT-v2, which rely on much larger datasets ($\sim$21M samples). The code and VPP-SFT dataset will be available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MathFlow: Enhancing the Perceptual Flow of MLLMs for Visual Mathematical Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16549v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive performance across diverse tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have yet to fully demonstrate their potential in visual mathematical problem-solving, particularly in accurately perceiving and interpreting diagrams. Inspired by typical processes of humans, we hypothesize that the perception capabilities to extract meaningful information from diagrams is crucial, as it directly impacts subsequent inference processes. To validate this hypothesis, we developed FlowVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes all information used during problem-solving into four components, which are then combined into six problem versions for evaluation. Our preliminary results on FlowVerse reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit substantial limitations when extracting essential information and reasoned property from diagrams and performing complex reasoning based on these visual inputs. In response, we introduce MathFlow, a modular problem-solving pipeline that decouples perception and inference into distinct stages, thereby optimizing each independently. Given the perceptual limitations observed in current MLLMs, we trained MathFlow-P-7B as a dedicated perception model. Experimental results indicate that MathFlow-P-7B yields substantial performance gains when integrated with various closed-source and open-source inference models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the MathFlow pipeline and its compatibility to diverse inference frameworks. The FlowVerse benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/MathFlow-zju/MathFlow.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/MathFlow-zju/MathFlow</p></details> |

However, the authenticity of the responses generated by MLLMs is often compromised by object hallucinations. We identify that a key cause of these hallucinations is the model's over-susceptibility to specific image frequency features in detecting objects. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Frequency Perturbations (MFP), a simple, cost-effective, and pluggable method that leverages both low-frequency and high-frequency features of images to perturb visual feature representations and explicitly suppress redundant frequency-domain features during inference, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates object hallucinations across various model architectures. Furthermore, as a training-time method, MFP can be combined with inference-time methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.

However, unlike natural images or documents, GUIs comprise artificially designed graphical elements arranged to convey specific semantic meanings. Current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) already proficient in processing graphical and textual components suffer from hurdles in GUI understanding due to the lack of explicit spatial structure modeling. Moreover, obtaining high-quality spatial structure data is challenging due to privacy issues and noisy environments. To address these challenges, we present MP-GUI, a specially designed MLLM for GUI understanding. MP-GUI features three precisely specialized perceivers to extract graphical, textual, and spatial modalities from the screen as GUI-tailored visual clues, with spatial structure refinement strategy and adaptively combined via a fusion gate to meet the specific preferences of different GUI understanding tasks. To cope with the scarcity of training data, we also introduce a pipeline for automatically data collecting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MP-GUI achieves impressive results on various GUI understanding tasks with limited data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, inherent challenges like long-tailed class distributions and prediction variability necessitate uncertainty quantification in SGG for its practical viability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Conformal Prediction (CP) based framework, adaptive to any existing SGG method, for quantifying their predictive uncertainty by constructing well-calibrated prediction sets over their generated scene graphs. These scene graph prediction sets are designed to achieve statistically rigorous coverage guarantees. Additionally, to ensure these prediction sets contain the most practically interpretable scene graphs, we design an effective MLLM-based post-processing strategy for selecting the most visually and semantically plausible scene graphs within these prediction sets. We show that our proposed approach can produce diverse possible scene graphs from an image, assess the reliability of SGG methods, and improve overall SGG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference.</p></details> |  |

In this context, we identify two key challenges: cross-modal distraction and geometric feasibility. Cross-modal distraction occurs when the inclusion of visual input degrades the reasoning performance of a MLLM. Geometric feasibility refers to the ability of MLLMs to ensure that the selected skills are physically executable in the environment. To address these issues, we adapt Chain of Thought (CoT) with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and use affordance predictor as skill preconditions to guide MLLM on geometric feasibility. We construct a dataset to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning and collision avoidance. We conducted a detailed evaluation to identify issues among different baselines and analyze the reasons for improvement, providing insights into each approach. Our method reaches a success rate of 76.7% on the entire dataset, showing a substantial improvement over the CoT baseline at 36.7%.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce EMA, an Efficient Motion-Aware video MLLM that utilizes compressed video structures as inputs. We propose a motion-aware GOP (Group of Pictures) encoder that fuses spatial and motion information within a GOP unit in the compressed video stream, generating compact, informative visual tokens. By integrating fewer but denser RGB frames with more but sparser motion vectors in this native slow-fast input architecture, our approach reduces redundancy and enhances motion representation. Additionally, we introduce MotionBench, a benchmark for evaluating motion understanding across four motion types: linear, curved, rotational, and contact-based. Experimental results show that EMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MotionBench and popular video question answering benchmarks, while reducing inference costs. Moreover, EMA demonstrates strong scalability, as evidenced by its competitive performance on long video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

| **[Towards Self-Improving Systematic Cognition for Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges with fine-grained perception and complex reasoning. Prevalent multimodal pre-training approaches in MLLM construction focus on enhancing perception by training on high-quality image captions. While leveraging advanced MLLMs for caption generation enhances scalability, their outputs often lack comprehensiveness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework designed to construct next-generation foundation MLLMs by enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description (CoD), an approach that improves an MLLM's systematic perception by enabling step-by-step visual understanding. CoD sequentially focuses on salient content, fine-grained details, relational attributes, and peripheral context, before generating a coherent description, ensuring greater accuracy and comprehensiveness. Additionally, we adopt a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning technique to enable MLLMs to integrate in-depth multimodal reasoning. To construct a next-generation foundation MLLM with self-improved cognition, SIcog first equips an MLLM with systematic perception and reasoning abilities using minimal external annotations. The enhanced models then generate detailed captions and CoT reasoning data, which are further curated through self-consistency. This curated data is ultimately used for multimodal pre-training to develop next-generation foundation models. Extensive experiments on both low- and high-resolution MLLMs across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with significantly improved cognition, achieving benchmark-leading performance compared to prevalent pre-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages.

| **[CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10391v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 14.3% compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Density Principle for MLLM Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10079v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hundreds of benchmarks have been developed to ensure the reliability of MLLMs in downstream tasks. However, the evaluation mechanism itself may not be reliable. For developers of MLLMs, questions remain about which benchmark to use and whether the test results meet their requirements. Therefore, we propose a critical principle of Information Density, which examines how much insight a benchmark can provide for the development of MLLMs. We characterize it from four key dimensions: (1) Fallacy, (2) Difficulty, (3) Redundancy, (4) Diversity. Through a comprehensive analysis of more than 10,000 samples, we measured the information density of 19 MLLM benchmarks. Experiments show that using the latest benchmarks in testing can provide more insight compared to previous ones, but there is still room for improvement in their information density. We hope this principle can promote the development and application of future MLLM benchmarks. Project page: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/bench4bench</p></details> |  |
| **[UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique aspects of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D. Our approach features a progressive training pipeline with three stages: Teacher Self-Preparation, Teacher-Student Guidance, and Student Self-Practice. Additionally, we propose an instruction-tuning data EgoIT from multiple sources to strengthen the model's instruction-following capabilities, along with the EgoBench benchmark comprising eight different tasks for thorough evaluation. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://egovisiongroup.github.io/Exo2Ego.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SegAgent: Exploring Pixel Understanding Capabilities in MLLMs by Imitating Human Annotator Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08625v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While MLLMs have demonstrated adequate image understanding capabilities, they still struggle with pixel-level comprehension, limiting their practical applications. Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |

Hybrid Retrieval, which integrates Sparse Retrieval (e.g., BM25) and Dense Retrieval (e.g., vector embeddings), has become a widely adopted approach for improving search effectiveness. However, its performance heavily depends on the quality of input text, which is often degraded when dealing with non-narrative documents such as PDFs containing financial statements, contractual clauses, and tables. KAP addresses these challenges by integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with LLM-driven post-OCR processing, refining extracted text to reduce OCR noise, restore table structures, and optimize text format. By ensuring better compatibility with Hybrid Retrieval, KAP improves the accuracy of both Sparse and Dense Retrieval methods without modifying the retrieval architecture itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Reallocation: Towards Zero-cost and Controllable Hallucination Mitigation of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08342v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand out in various tasks but still struggle with hallucinations. While recent training-free mitigation methods mostly introduce additional inference overhead via retrospection strategy and contrastive decoding, we propose attention reallocation (AttnReal) to mitigate hallucinations with nearly zero extra cost. Our approach is motivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention distribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which further contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap between different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles excessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens, which reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding process depends more on the visual inputs. More interestingly, we find that, by controlling the intensity of AttnReal, we can achieve a wide-range trade-off between the response faithfulness and overall performance. Comprehensive results from different benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AttnReal across six open-source MLLMs and three decoding strategies.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneously, increasing LMs' "thinking" time through scaling test-time compute has proven an effective technique to solve challenging problems in domains such as math and code. This raises a natural question: can an LM's evaluation capability also be improved by spending more test-time compute? To answer this, we investigate employing reasoning models-LMs that natively generate long chain-of-thought reasoning-as evaluators. Specifically, we examine methods to leverage more test-time compute by (1) using reasoning models, and (2) prompting these models to evaluate not only the response as a whole (i.e., outcome evaluation) but also assess each step in the response separately (i.e., process evaluation). In experiments, we observe that the evaluator's performance improves monotonically when generating more reasoning tokens, similar to the trends observed in LM-based generation. Furthermore, we use these more accurate evaluators to rerank multiple generations, and demonstrate that spending more compute at evaluation time can be as effective as using more compute at generation time in improving an LM's problem-solving capability.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques.

However, existing benchmarks for VLMs include spatial components, which often fail to isolate spatial reasoning from related tasks such as object detection or semantic comprehension. In this paper, we address these deficiencies with a multi-faceted approach towards understanding spatial reasoning. Informed by the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of human spatial reasoning abilities, we present a detailed analysis that first delineates the core elements of spatial reasoning: spatial relations, orientation and navigation, mental rotation, and spatial visualization, and then assesses the performance of these models in both synthetic and real-world images, bridging controlled and naturalistic contexts. We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering pivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal profound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13 models approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a persistent obstacle. This work not only exposes the pressing need to advance spatial reasoning within VLMs but also establishes a solid platform for future exploration.

These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well. We are releasing these 1.4 million problems and their corresponding responses to the research community with the objective of fostering the development of powerful reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs).

RLLMs exhibit innate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capability obtained from training, leading to a natural question: "Is CoT prompting, a popular In-Context Learning (ICL) method for chat LLMs, necessary to enhance the reasoning capability of RLLMs?" In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impacts of Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT on RLLMs across mathematical reasoning tasks. We examine models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, finding that contrary to concerns, CoT prompting significantly enhances RLLMs' performance in most scenarios. Our results reveal distinct patterns: large-capacity models show minimal improvement on simple tasks but substantial gains on complex problems, while smaller models exhibit the opposite behavior. Further analysis demonstrates that CoT prompting effectively controls the distribution of the numbers of thinking tokens and reasoning steps, reducing excessive reflections by approximately 90% in some cases. Moreover, attention logits analysis reveals the RLLMs' overfitting to reflection-related words, which is mitigated by external CoT guidance. Notably, our experiments indicate that for RLLMs, one-shot CoT consistently yields superior performance compared to Few-shot CoT approaches. Our findings provide important insights for optimizing RLLMs' performance through appropriate prompting strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19599v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against natural language requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program analysis and verification to natural language artifacts. Drawing inspiration from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various points in the code. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 62% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by increasing the MCC by 93%.

However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process or Result? Manipulated Ending Tokens Can Mislead Reasoning LLMs to Ignore the Correct Reasoning Steps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19326v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in mathematical reasoning capabilities through long Chain-of-Thought. The reasoning tokens of these models enable self-correction within reasoning chains, enhancing robustness. This motivates our exploration: how vulnerable are reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input reasoning chains? We introduce "Compromising Thought" (CPT), a vulnerability where models presented with reasoning tokens containing manipulated calculation results tend to ignore correct reasoning steps and adopt incorrect results instead. Through systematic evaluation across multiple reasoning LLMs, we design three increasingly explicit prompting methods to measure CPT resistance, revealing that models struggle significantly to identify and correct these manipulations. Notably, contrary to existing research suggesting structural alterations affect model performance more than content modifications, we find that local ending token manipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural changes. Moreover, we discover a security vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1 where tampered reasoning tokens can trigger complete reasoning cessation. Our work enhances understanding of reasoning robustness and highlights security considerations for reasoning-intensive applications.</p></details> |  |

While Unified Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, they struggle with contextual reasoning in T2I-ICL scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates a thought process called ImageGen-CoT prior to image generation. To avoid generating unstructured ineffective reasoning steps, we develop an automatic pipeline to curate a high-quality ImageGen-CoT dataset. We then fine-tune MLLMs using this dataset to enhance their contextual reasoning capabilities. To further enhance performance, we explore test-time scale-up strategies and propose a novel hybrid scaling approach. This approach first generates multiple ImageGen-CoT chains and then produces multiple images for each chain via sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, fine-tuning with the ImageGen-CoT dataset leads to a substantial 80\% performance gain for SEED-X on T2I-ICL tasks. See our project page at https://ImageGen-CoT.github.io/.

Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.</p></details> |  |

We present MIRAGE, a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that exploits narrative-driven context and role immersion to circumvent safety mechanisms in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By systematically decomposing the toxic query into environment, role, and action triplets, MIRAGE constructs a multi-turn visual storytelling sequence of images and text using Stable Diffusion, guiding the target model through an engaging detective narrative. This process progressively lowers the model's defences and subtly guides its reasoning through structured contextual cues, ultimately eliciting harmful responses. In extensive experiments on the selected datasets with six mainstream MLLMs, MIRAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving attack success rates by up to 17.5% over the best baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that role immersion and structured semantic reconstruction can activate inherent model biases, facilitating the model's spontaneous violation of ethical safeguards. These results highlight critical weaknesses in current multimodal safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defences against cross-modal threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[I Have Covered All the Bases Here: Interpreting Reasoning Features in Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18878v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. Recent advances have led to the developing of a new class of reasoning LLMs; for example, open-source DeepSeek-R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning. Despite these impressive capabilities, the internal reasoning mechanisms of such models remain unexplored. In this work, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a method to learn a sparse decomposition of latent representations of a neural network into interpretable features, to identify features that drive reasoning in the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. First, we propose an approach to extract candidate ''reasoning features'' from SAE representations. We validate these features through empirical analysis and interpretability methods, demonstrating their direct correlation with the model's reasoning abilities. Crucially, we demonstrate that steering these features systematically enhances reasoning performance, offering the first mechanistic account of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning to Learn from Latent Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18866v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has outpaced the growth of human-written texts, leading to concerns that data will become the bottleneck to LM scaling. To continue scaling pretraining in this data-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the latent thoughts that underlie the text generation process can significantly improve pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text as the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the latent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that are critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining for math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent thoughts significantly improve data efficiency, outperforming training on the same amount of raw data (5.7\% $\rightarrow$ 25.4\% on MATH). Furthermore, we demonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM bootstraps its own performance by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented pretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at least three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing the E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new opportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.</p></details> |  |

By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.</p></details> |  |

AlphaSpace employs a semantics-based tokenization strategy, encoding height information through specialized semantic tokens, and integrates primarily symbolic synthetic reasoning data. This approach enables LLMs to accurately manipulate objects by positioning them at specific [x, y, z] coordinates.

| **[Training-Free Personalization via Retrieval and Reasoning on Fingerprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18623v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have lead to major improvements in multimodal reasoning, yet they still struggle to understand user-specific concepts. Existing personalization methods address this limitation but heavily rely on training procedures, that can be either costly or unpleasant to individual users. We depart from existing work, and for the first time explore the training-free setting in the context of personalization. We propose a novel method, Retrieval and Reasoning for Personalization (R2P), leveraging internal knowledge of VLMs. First, we leverage VLMs to extract the concept fingerprint, i.e., key attributes uniquely defining the concept within its semantic class. When a query arrives, the most similar fingerprints are retrieved and scored via chain-of-thought-reasoning. To reduce the risk of hallucinations, the scores are validated through cross-modal verification at the attribute level: in case of a discrepancy between the scores, R2P refines the concept association via pairwise multimodal matching, where the retrieved fingerprints and their images are directly compared with the query. We validate R2P on two publicly available benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, Personal Concepts with Visual Ambiguity (PerVA), for concept identification highlighting challenges in visual ambiguity. R2P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various downstream tasks across all benchmarks. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, as training data, it provides richer contextual reasoning information, thereby guiding the model to achieve better performance. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) primarily rely on single-turn dialogue training and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, following the characteristics of human dialogue, such as focused topics and concise, clear content, we present MMCR (Multimodal Multi-turn Contextual Reasoning), a novel dataset comprising: (1) MMCR-310k -- the largest multi-image multi-turn instruction tuning dataset with 310K contextual dialogues, each covering 1-4 images and 4 or 8 dialogue turns; and (2) MMCR-Bench -- a diagnostic benchmark featuring dialogues, spanning 8 domains (Humanities, Natural, Science, Education, etc.) and 40 sub-topics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that models fine-tuned with MMCR-310k achieve 5.2\% higher contextual accuracy on MMCR-Bench, while showing consistent improvements on existing benchmarks (+1.1\% on AI2D, +1.2\% on MMMU and MMVet). MMCR and prompt engineering will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/PzySeere/MetaSpatial.</p></details> | Working Paper |

These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well. We are releasing these 1.4 million problems and their corresponding responses to the research community with the objective of fostering the development of powerful reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs).

| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we frame game balancing as a procedural content generation task and propose an architecture for automatically balancing of tile-based levels within the PCGRL framework (procedural content generation via reinforcement learning). Our architecture is divided into three parts: (1) a level generator, (2) a balancing agent, and (3) a reward modeling simulation. Through repeated simulations, the balancing agent receives rewards for adjusting the level towards a given balancing objective, such as equal win rates for all players. To this end, we propose new swap-based representations to improve the robustness of playability, thereby enabling agents to balance game levels more effectively and quickly compared to traditional PCGRL. By analyzing the agent's swapping behavior, we can infer which tile types have the most impact on the balance. We validate our approach in the Neural MMO (NMMO) environment in a competitive two-player scenario. In this extended conference paper, we present improved results, explore the applicability of the method to various forms of balancing beyond equal balancing, compare the performance to another search-based approach, and discuss the application of existing fairness metrics to game balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the journal (IEEE Transactions on Games) paper of the same name</p></details> |

However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-wise Multi-dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling. The code is available at https://github.com/Galery23/Similar-v1.</p></details> |  |

However, current alignment methods face three main limitations: (1) reliance on costly human annotation; (2) alignment tax; (3) shallow alignment vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Additionally, current alignment datasets often suffer from uneven distributions, leading to overrepresentation of some topics and neglect of others. To address these issues, we propose SRMIR (Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning), inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. We first construct a balanced safety Chain of Draft (CoD) dataset across $7$ harmful types with structured prompt leveraging the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs, then train a set of specialized reward models to guide policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We apply two strategies, linear combination and categorized approach, to integrate shadow reward models for policy optimization. By comparison, we find that the latter achieves superior alignment despite higher computational costs. Experiments across several LLMs demonstrate SRMIR significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, preference optimization, derived from the language domain, has emerged as an effective post-training reinforcement strategy to enhance capabilities of LVLMs. However, constructing high-quality human-annotated preference data and developing robust reward models to mimic these preferences are both costly and challenging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Vision-R1, a novel vision-guided R1-like reinforcement learning algorithm for LVLMs that rewards models with definitive vision feedback. It only leverages curated instruction data, eliminating the need for specialized reward models and handcrafted preference datasets. We incorporate a criterion-driven reward function that further integrates multi-dimensional feedback to evaluate model completions comprehensively based on the vision task logic. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive rule refinement strategy that dynamically adjusts the reward criteria during training, enabling continuous model improvement and mitigating reward hacking. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the 7B LVLMs with Vision-R1 achieves consistent performance gains, with even up to 50% improvement and surpassing the state-of-the-art 10x size model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project in development.

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Judge Anything: MLLM as a Judge Across Any Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17489v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating generative foundation models on open-ended multimodal understanding (MMU) and generation (MMG) tasks across diverse modalities (e.g., images, audio, video) poses significant challenges due to the complexity of cross-modal interactions. To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing vision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends MLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two benchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the overall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any modality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG capabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries curated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates the judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from the perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a standardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in assessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting and 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges with MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and 30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and hallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated platform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models. Our work highlights the need for fairer evaluation protocols and stronger alignment with human preferences.

Traditional inference time scaling methods utilize scalar reward signals from process reward models to evaluate candidate reasoning steps, but these scalar rewards lack the nuanced qualitative information essential for understanding and justifying each step. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time scaling approach -- stepwise natural language self-critique (PANEL), which employs self-generated natural language critiques as feedback to guide the step-level search process. By generating rich, human-readable critiques for each candidate reasoning step, PANEL retains essential qualitative information, facilitating better-informed decision-making during inference. This approach bypasses the need for task-specific verifiers and the associated training overhead, making it broadly applicable across diverse tasks. Experimental results on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME and GPQA, demonstrate that PANEL significantly enhances reasoning performance, outperforming traditional scalar reward-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/puddingyeah/PANEL to support and encourage future research in this promising field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17338v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward model that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We propose a method to specialise a reward model to a person or group of people. Our approach builds on the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive reward model and also adaptive counterparts, including models that do in-context personalisation. Depending on how much disagreement there is in the training data, our model either significantly outperforms the baselines or matches their performance with a simpler architecture and more stable training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Additive Contextual Bandits: A Nonparametric Approach for Online Decision-making with High-dimensional Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16941v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized services are central to today's digital landscape, where online decision-making is commonly formulated as contextual bandit problems. Two key challenges emerge in modern applications: high-dimensional covariates and the need for nonparametric models to capture complex reward-covariate relationships. We address these challenges by developing a contextual bandit algorithm based on sparse additive reward models in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We establish statistical properties of the doubly penalized method applied to random regions, introducing novel analyses under bandit feedback. Our algorithm achieves sublinear cumulative regret over the time horizon $T$ while scaling logarithmically with covariate dimensionality $d$. Notably, we provide the first regret upper bound with logarithmic growth in $d$ for nonparametric contextual bandits with high-dimensional covariates. We also establish a lower bound, with the gap to the upper bound vanishing as smoothness increases. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance in high-dimensional settings compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16400v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16094v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks. These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model. Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data. The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable. This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in LLama-3-8B-Instruct's cultural dimensions across multiple regions, outperforming both the Naive LLM and the In-context Learning (ICL) baseline, and effectively bridges computational models with human cultural nuances.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/princeton-pli/what-makes-good-rm</p></details> |
| **[VARP: Reinforcement Learning from Vision-Language Model Feedback with Agent Regularized Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13817v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing reward functions for continuous-control robotics often leads to subtle misalignments or reward hacking, especially in complex tasks. Preference-based RL mitigates some of these pitfalls by learning rewards from comparative feedback rather than hand-crafted signals, yet scaling human annotations remains challenging. Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails to capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part solution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning with the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final observations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable preferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld tasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's performance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data generated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30% in locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method achieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to below 50% for standard approaches. These results underscore the efficacy of combining richer visual representations with agent-aware reward regularization.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Superalignment with Dynamic Human Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13621v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two core challenges of alignment are 1) scalable oversight and 2) accounting for the dynamic nature of human values. While solutions like recursive reward modeling address 1), they do not simultaneously account for 2). We sketch a roadmap for a novel algorithmic framework that trains a superhuman reasoning model to decompose complex tasks into subtasks that are still amenable to human-level guidance. Our approach relies on what we call the part-to-complete generalization hypothesis, which states that the alignment of subtask solutions generalizes to the alignment of complete solutions. We advocate for the need to measure this generalization and propose ways to improve it in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Bidirectional Human-AI Alignment (BiAlign)</p></details> |
| **[MetaScale: Test-Time Scaling with Evolving Meta-Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13447v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex reasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data, instead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to solve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that enhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time scaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts, then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on Arena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control. Notably, METASCALE scales more effectively with increasing sampling budgets and produces more structured, expert-level responses.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Iterative DPO: A Comprehensive Empirical Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12854v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in post-training methodologies for large language models (LLMs) have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a critical component for enhancing reasoning. However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose a novel reward model approach, Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps from fine-grained and coarse-grained level. HRM performs better in assessing reasoning coherence and self-reflection, particularly when the previous reasoning step is incorrect. Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model.</p></details> |  |
