| **[Generalization in Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08988v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) typically models the interaction between the agent and environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the rewards that guide the agent's behavior are always observable. However, in many real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation (FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[InfoPO: On Mutual Information Maximization for Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08507v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the post-training of large language models (LLMs) with human preference data. Recently, direct preference optimization and its variants have shown considerable promise in aligning language models, eliminating the need for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, these methods rely on explicit assumptions about the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which makes them prone to overfitting and results in suboptimal performance, particularly on reasoning-heavy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a principled preference fine-tuning algorithm called InfoPO, which effectively and efficiently aligns large language models using preference data. InfoPO eliminates the reliance on the BT model and prevents the likelihood of the chosen response from decreasing. Extensive experiments confirm that InfoPO consistently outperforms established baselines on widely used open benchmarks, particularly in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[DanceGRPO: Unleashing GRPO on Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07818v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dancegrpo.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[On the Robustness of Reward Models for Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07271v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness, reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization, losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch, constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization, where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training. We release the code, data, and models: https://github.com/LinkedIn-XFACT/RM-Robustness.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Skywork-VL Reward: An Effective Reward Model for Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07263v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Skywork-VL Reward, a multimodal reward model that provides reward signals for both multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Our technical approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios, with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data. Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for multimodal alignment. Our model has been publicly released to promote transparency and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Guarantee of Reward Modeling Using Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06601v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning algorithms and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Feedback Efficient Active Target Discovery in Partially Observable Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06535v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 28 figures, Pre-print</p></details> |
| **[TREND: Tri-teaching for Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06079v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference feedback collected by human or VLM annotators is often noisy, presenting a significant challenge for preference-based reinforcement learning that relies on accurate preference labels. To address this challenge, we propose TREND, a novel framework that integrates few-shot expert demonstrations with a tri-teaching strategy for effective noise mitigation. Our method trains three reward models simultaneously, where each model views its small-loss preference pairs as useful knowledge and teaches such useful pairs to its peer network for updating the parameters. Remarkably, our approach requires as few as one to three expert demonstrations to achieve high performance. We evaluate TREND on various robotic manipulation tasks, achieving up to 90% success rates even with noise levels as high as 40%, highlighting its effective robustness in handling noisy preference feedback.

| **[ReAlign: Bilingual Text-to-Motion Generation via Step-Aware Reward-Guided Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04974v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset, which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD), which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics, thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Reward-SQL: Boosting Text-to-SQL via Stepwise Reasoning and Process-Supervised Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04671v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision" paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMRL: Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning for Data Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06284v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are inherently vulnerable to unintended privacy breaches. Consequently, systematic red-teaming research is essential for developing robust defense mechanisms. However, current data extraction methods suffer from several limitations: (1) rely on dataset duplicates (addressable via deduplication), (2) depend on prompt engineering (now countered by detection and defense), and (3) rely on random-search adversarial generation. To address these challenges, we propose DMRL, a Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning approach for data extraction. This technique leverages inverse reinforcement learning to extract sensitive data from LLMs. Our method consists of two main components: (1) constructing an introspective reasoning dataset that captures leakage mindsets to guide model behavior, and (2) training reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization based on task difficulty at both the data and model levels. Comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate that DMRL outperforms all baseline methods in data extraction performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data-...</summary><p>Data- and Model-aware Reward Learning for Data Extraction. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.18991</p></details> |
| **[PARM: Multi-Objective Test-Time Alignment via Preference-Aware Autoregressive Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06274v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective test-time alignment aims to adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse multi-dimensional user preferences during inference while keeping LLMs frozen. Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently trains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension without awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on user-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective test-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for \textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training of ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user preferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a single unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our proposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs a bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to achieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Experiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better alignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally, PARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger frozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment accessible with limited computing resources. The code is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/PARM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ergodic Generative Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03561v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reward Model through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03318v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/think</p></details> |
| **[Soft Best-of-n Sampling for Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03156v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling is a practical approach for aligning language model outputs with human preferences without expensive fine-tuning. BoN sampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then selecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward values in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence between the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely controlled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward at a higher distortion cost. We introduce Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling, a generalization of BoN that allows for smooth interpolation between the original distribution and reward-maximizing distribution through a temperature parameter $\lambda$. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling converges sharply to the optimal tilted distribution at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in KL and the expected (relative) reward. For sequences of discrete outputs, we analyze an additive reward model that reveals the fundamental limitations of blockwise sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2025)</p></details> |
| **[R1-Reward: Training Multimodal Reward Model Through Stable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02835v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Home ...</summary><p>Home page: https://github.com/yfzhang114/r1_reward</p></details> |
| **[Sailing AI by the Stars: A Survey of Learning from Rewards in Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02686v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards. We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges and future directions. We maintain a paper collection at https://github.com/bobxwu/learning-from-rewards-llm-papers.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[A Survey on Progress in LLM Alignment from the Perspective of Reward Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02666v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions represents a core challenge in current AI research, where reward mechanism design has become a critical factor in shaping model behavior. This study conducts a comprehensive investigation of reward mechanisms in LLM alignment through a systematic theoretical framework, categorizing their development into three key phases: (1) feedback (diagnosis), (2) reward design (prescription), and (3) optimization (treatment). Through a four-dimensional analysis encompassing construction basis, format, expression, and granularity, this research establishes a systematic classification framework that reveals evolutionary trends in reward modeling. The field of LLM alignment faces several persistent challenges, while recent advances in reward design are driving significant paradigm shifts. Notable developments include the transition from reinforcement learning-based frameworks to novel optimization paradigms, as well as enhanced capabilities to address complex alignment scenarios involving multimodal integration and concurrent task coordination. Finally, this survey outlines promising future research directions for LLM alignment through innovative reward design strategies.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Survey of Slow Thinking-based Reasoning LLMs using Reinforced Learning and Inference-time Scaling Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02665v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

How Can We Help Them Think Like Scientists?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09614v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established "Blicket Test" paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating GPT- and Reasoning-based Large Language Models on Physics Olympiad Problems: Surpassing Human Performance and Implications for Educational Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09438v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are now widely accessible, reaching learners at all educational levels. This development has raised concerns that their use may circumvent essential learning processes and compromise the integrity of established assessment formats. In physics education, where problem solving plays a central role in instruction and assessment, it is therefore essential to understand the physics-specific problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. Such understanding is key to informing responsible and pedagogically sound approaches to integrating LLMs into instruction and assessment. This study therefore compares the problem-solving performance of a general-purpose LLM (GPT-4o, using varying prompting techniques) and a reasoning-optimized model (o1-preview) with that of participants of the German Physics Olympiad, based on a set of well-defined Olympiad problems. In addition to evaluating the correctness of the generated solutions, the study analyzes characteristic strengths and limitations of LLM-generated solutions. The findings of this study indicate that both tested LLMs (GPT-4o and o1-preview) demonstrate advanced problem-solving capabilities on Olympiad-type physics problems, on average outperforming the human participants. Prompting techniques had little effect on GPT-4o's performance, while o1-preview almost consistently outperformed both GPT-4o and the human benchmark. Based on these findings, the study discusses implications for the design of summative and formative assessment in physics education, including how to uphold assessment integrity and support students in critically engaging with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAG-Enabled Intent Reasoning for Application-Network Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09339v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-based network (IBN) is a promising solution to automate network operation and management. IBN aims to offer human-tailored network interaction, allowing the network to communicate in a way that aligns with the network users' language, rather than requiring the network users to understand the technical language of the network/devices. Nowadays, different applications interact with the network, each with its own specialized needs and domain language. Creating semantic languages (i.e., ontology-based languages) and associating them with each application to facilitate intent translation lacks technical expertise and is neither practical nor scalable. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a context-aware AI framework that utilizes machine reasoning (MR), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and generative AI technologies to interpret intents from different applications and generate structured network intents. The proposed framework allows for generalized/domain-specific intent expression and overcomes the drawbacks of large language models (LLMs) and vanilla-RAG framework. The experimental results show that our proposed intent-RAG framework outperforms the LLM and vanilla-RAG framework in intent translation.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static, pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over baseline methods. These results highlight InForage's effectiveness in building robust, adaptive, and efficient reasoning agents.</p></details> | 16 pages |

This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First, our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities, converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements on complex scene understanding tasks. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/open_upon_acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Known: Decision Making with Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09114v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Ornithologist uses ``taxonomy-guided reasoning'', guiding a large language model with human-authored decision trees. This increases the transparency and explainability of the system and makes it accessible to non-experts. It also reduces hallucination risk. Since it requires less supervision than traditional classification systems, it can more easily be applied to other problems or sources of text (e.g. news) without much modification. Ornithologist measurements of hawkishness and dovishness of RBA communication carry information about the future of the cash rate path and of market expectations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation. ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[AC-Reason: Towards Theory-Guided Actual Causality Reasoning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08750v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world scenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC theory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason, a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g., sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a theory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal structure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on actual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench present greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over baselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 + AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts. Finally, our ablation study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRAIL: Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08638v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/TRAIL</p></details> |
| **[From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08548v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.</p></details> | Early version |
| **[Judging the Judges: Can Large Vision-Language Models Fairly Evaluate Chart Comprehension and Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08468v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data. Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering, chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters) suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy. Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4 judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference and length bias persist.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[VCRBench: Exploring Long-form Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08455v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal. Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: When Goal-Gradient Importance Meets Dynamic Skipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08392v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex tasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and inefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current CoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and static compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical tokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic CoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two synergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric accurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient influence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and (2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the compression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local coherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the first work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with dynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed MATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization across diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It achieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45% on average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining high reasoning accuracy. Notably, it significantly outperforms existing baselines by preserving accuracy even at high effective compression rates, advancing the state of the art in the CoT reasoning efficiency-accuracy trade-off.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Like Humans: Advancing LLM Reasoning Capabilities via Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning and Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08364v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figs |
| **[An Identifiable Cost-Aware Causal Decision-Making Framework Using Counterfactual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08343v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios, existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

Outperforming DeepSeek-R1 and rivaling leading Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models like Qwen3-235B-A22B and Seed1.5-Thinking, AM-Thinking-v1 achieves impressive scores of 85.3 on AIME 2024, 74.4 on AIME 2025, and 70.3 on LiveCodeBench, showcasing state-of-the-art mathematical and coding capabilities among open-source models of similar scale. Built entirely from the open-source Qwen2.5-32B base model and publicly available queries, AM-Thinking-v1 leverages a meticulously crafted post-training pipeline - combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning - to deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities. This work demonstrates that the open-source community can achieve high performance at the 32B scale, a practical sweet spot for deployment and fine-tuning. By striking a balance between top-tier performance and real-world usability, we hope AM-Thinking-v1 inspires further collaborative efforts to harness mid-scale models, pushing reasoning boundaries while keeping accessibility at the core of innovation. We have open-sourced our model on \href{https://huggingface.co/a-m-team/AM-Thinking-v1}{Hugging Face}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Strategies for Efficient Embodied Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08243v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT) -- wherein a model predicts helpful intermediate representations before choosing actions -- provides an effective method for improving the generalization and performance of robot policies, especially vision-language-action models (VLAs). While such approaches have been shown to improve performance and generalization, they suffer from core limitations, like needing specialized robot reasoning data and slow inference speeds. To design new robot reasoning approaches that address these issues, a more complete characterization of why reasoning helps policy performance is critical. We hypothesize several mechanisms by which robot reasoning improves policies -- (1) better representation learning, (2) improved learning curricularization, and (3) increased expressivity -- then devise simple variants of robot CoT reasoning to isolate and test each one. We find that learning to generate reasonings does lead to better VLA representations, while attending to the reasonings aids in actually leveraging these features for improved action prediction. Our results provide us with a better understanding of why CoT reasoning helps VLAs, which we use to introduce two simple and lightweight alternative recipes for robot reasoning. Our proposed approaches achieve significant performance gains over non-reasoning policies, state-of-the-art results on the LIBERO-90 benchmark, and a 3x inference speedup compared to standard robot reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08140v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</p></details> | 28 pages |
