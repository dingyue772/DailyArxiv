| **[MCA-LLaVA: Manhattan Causal Attention for Reducing Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09184v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment. We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code can be accessed in https://github.com/ErikZ719/MCA-LLaVA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision language models better captured these differences than text-only language models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for the imagery spectrum.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoRAG-LoRA: Hallucination-Triggered Knowledge Retuning via Lightweight Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10586v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations - factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Guided Decoding for Object Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07731v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes'' ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets. Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |

| **[INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05056v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Tri-Space Tension: ARC-Guided Hallucination Modeling and Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04946v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent "hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We withdraw this paper due to significant visualization errors in Figure 3 and 5 that affect the correctness of our core modeling claims and may cause misinterpretation.

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,6 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Level Hallucination Detection via Variance in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04137v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[KEA Explain: Explanations of Hallucinations using Graph Kernel Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03847v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a foundation for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |

While adopting emerging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming a necessity to achieve these goals, the risk of hallucination remains a major challenge. In this paper, we present a multi-agent system to handle customer requests sent via SMS. This system integrates LLM based agents with fuzzy logic to mitigate hallucination risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ONLY: One-Layer Intervention Sufficiently Mitigates Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00898v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses. Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However, these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding, enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort and computational cost.

However, most of the research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3 - Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, SemEval-2025 Task 3, ACL</p></details> |
| **[CAI: Caption-Sensitive Attention Intervention for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23590v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination. To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs' visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only with minimal additional inference cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCo: Reminder Composition Mitigates Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22636v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e., generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled. Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions, we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve improved results for each one.</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21546v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://plan-lab.github.io/hallusegbench/</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Hallucination for Self-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20342v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis; it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D, AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained action dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |

Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability.</p></details> |  |
| **[The downgrading semantics of memory safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11282v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory safety is traditionally characterized in terms of bad things that cannot happen, an approach that is often criticized as unprincipled. Prior work suggest a connection between memory safety and noninterference, but no satisfactory semantic notion of memory safety is currently known. This work proposes a notion of gradual allocator independence that accurately captures many allocator-specific aspects of memory safety. We consider a low-level language with access to an allocator that provides malloc and free primitives in a flat memory model. Pointers are just integers, and as such it is trivial to write memory-unsafe programs. The basic intuition of gradual allocator independence is that of noninterference, namely that allocators must not influence program execution. This intuition is refined in two important ways to account for the allocators running out-of-memory and for programs to have pointer-to-integer casts. The key insight of the definition is to treat these extensions as forms of downgrading and give them satisfactory technical treatment using the state-of-the-art information flow machinery.</p></details> | 56 pages, 27 figures |

However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models.

In such scenarios, the presence of infinitely many subsystems within the network renders the existing analysis frameworks tailored for finite networks inapplicable to infinite ones. This paper is concerned with offering a data-driven approach, within a compositional framework, for the safety certification of infinite networks with both unknown mathematical models and interconnection topologies. Given the immense computational complexity stemming from the extensive dimension of infinite networks, our approach capitalizes on the joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems, characterized by storage certificates. We introduce innovative compositional data-driven conditions to construct a barrier certificate for the infinite network leveraging storage certificates of its unknown subsystems derived from data, while offering correctness guarantees across the network safety. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven reasoning eliminates the requirement for checking the traditional dissipativity condition, which typically mandates precise knowledge of the interconnection topology. In addition, while existing data-driven literature demonstrates an exponential trend in sample complexity with respect to network size, we showcase that our compositional strategy notably reduces it to a linear scale in terms of the number of subsystems. We illustrate our data-driven results on two physical infinite networks with unknown models and interconnection topologies.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Prospective Safety-Critical Applications of Complex Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10817v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of advanced computational modelling offers new opportunities to improve safety, efficacy, and emissions reductions. Application of complex models to support engineering decisions has been slow in comparison to other sectors, reflecting the higher consequence of unsafe applications. Adopting a complex model introduces a \emph{model risk}, namely the expected consequence of incorrect or otherwise unhelpful outputs. This should be weighed against the prospective benefits that the more sophisticated model can provide, also accounting for the non-zero risk of existing practice. Demonstrating when the model risk of a proposed machine learning application is As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) can help ensure that safety-critical industries benefit from complex models where appropriate while avoiding their misuse.

To address this, we propose Real-world Crash Grounding (RCG), a scenario generation framework that integrates crash-informed semantics into adversarial perturbation pipelines. We construct a safety-aware behavior representation through contrastive pre-training on large-scale driving logs, followed by fine-tuning on a small, crash-rich dataset with approximate trajectory annotations extracted from video. This embedding captures semantic structure aligned with real-world accident behaviors and supports selection of adversary trajectories that are both high-risk and behaviorally realistic. We incorporate the resulting selection mechanism into two prior scenario generation pipelines, replacing their handcrafted scoring objectives with an embedding-based criterion. Experimental results show that ego agents trained against these generated scenarios achieve consistently higher downstream success rates, with an average improvement of 9.2% across seven evaluation settings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses further demonstrate that our approach produces more plausible and nuanced adversary behaviors, enabling more effective and realistic stress testing of AD systems. Code and tools will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

However, existing safety tools often target different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and (3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more robust and reliable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025 [Actionable Interpretability Workshop]</p></details> |
| **[Mechanistic Interpretability of LoRA-Adapted Language Models for Nuclear Reactor Safety Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09931v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nuclear Technology. 22 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Remote Safety Monitoring: Significance-Aware Status Updating for Situational Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09833v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we consider a problem of remote safety monitoring, where a monitor pulls status updates from multiple sensors monitoring several safety-critical situations. Based on the received updates, multiple estimators determine the current safety-critical situations. Due to transmission errors and limited channel resources, the received status updates may not be fresh, resulting in the possibility of misunderstanding the current safety situation. In particular, if a dangerous situation is misinterpreted as safe, the safety risk is high. We study the joint design of transmission scheduling and estimation for multi-sensor, multi-channel remote safety monitoring, aiming to minimize the loss due to the unawareness of potential danger. We show that the joint design of transmission scheduling and estimation can be reduced to a sequential optimization of estimation and scheduling. The scheduling problem can be formulated as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) , for which it is difficult to establish indexability. We propose a low-complexity Maximum Gain First (MGF) policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal as the numbers of sources and channels scale up proportionally, without requiring the indexability condition. We also provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the transmission scheduling problem. Numerical results show that our estimation and scheduling policies achieves higher performance gain over periodic updating, randomized policy, and Maximum Age First (MAF) policy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Measuring What Matters: A Framework for Evaluating Safety Risks in Real-World LLM Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09820v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most safety testing efforts for large language models (LLMs) today focus on evaluating foundation models. However, there is a growing need to evaluate safety at the application level, as components such as system prompts, retrieval pipelines, and guardrails introduce additional factors that significantly influence the overall safety of LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a practical framework for evaluating application-level safety in LLM systems, validated through real-world deployment across multiple use cases within our organization. The framework consists of two parts: (1) principles for developing customized safety risk taxonomies, and (2) practices for evaluating safety risks in LLM applications. We illustrate how the proposed framework was applied in our internal pilot, providing a reference point for organizations seeking to scale their safety testing efforts. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts in AI safety and the operational realities of safeguarding LLM applications in practice, offering actionable guidance for safe and scalable deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Activation Patching: A Framework for Detecting and Mitigating Emergent Deception in Safety-Aligned Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09406v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.</p></details> |  |

However, their growing digital engagement exposes them to significant online risks, particularly in underrepresented contexts like West Africa. This study investigates the online experiences of 409 secondary school adolescents in Nigeria's Federal Capital Territory (FCT), focusing on their access to technology, exposure to risks, coping strategies, key stakeholders influencing their online interactions, and recommendations for improving online safety. Using self-administered surveys, we found that while most adolescents reported moderate access to online technology and connectivity, those who encountered risks frequently reported exposure to inappropriate content and online scams. Blocking and reporting tools were the most commonly used strategies, though some adolescents responded with inaction due to limited resources or awareness. Parents emerged as the primary support network, though monitoring practices and communication varied widely. Guided by Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), our analysis interprets adolescents' online safety behaviors as shaped by both their threat perceptions and their confidence in available coping strategies. A thematic analysis of their recommendations highlights the need for greater awareness and education, parental mediation, enhanced safety tools, stricter age restrictions, improved content moderation, government accountability, and resilience-building initiatives. Our findings underscore the importance of culturally and contextually relevant interventions to empower adolescents in navigating the digital world, with implications for parents, educators, designers, and policymakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Lightweight Safety Guardrails via Synthetic Data and RL-guided Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08284v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Set-Based Control Barrier Functions and Safety Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07805v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High performance and formal safety guarantees are common requirements for industrial control applications. Control barrier function (CBF) methods provide a systematic approach to the modularization of safety and performance. However, the design of such CBFs can be challenging, which limits their applicability to large-scale or data-driven systems. This paper introduces the concept of a set-based CBF for linear systems with convex constraints. By leveraging control invariant sets from reachability analysis and predictive control, the set-based CBF is defined implicitly through the minimal scaling of such a set to contain the current system state. This approach enables the development of implicit, data-driven, and high-dimensional CBF representations. The paper demonstrates the design of a safety filter using set-based CBFs, which is suitable for real-time implementations and learning-based approximations to reduce online computational demands. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through comprehensive simulations on a high-dimensional mass-spring-damper system and a motion control task, and it is validated experimentally using an electric drive application with short sampling times, highlighting its practical benefits for safety-critical control.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardVal: Dynamic Large Language Model Jailbreak Evaluation for Comprehensive Safety Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07735v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities. Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform future research and drive the development of more secure models.</p></details> | 24 pages |

The performance of prompt-engineered models, fine-tuned models, and a rule-based approach was compared. The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter model outperformed other models in its accuracy of extracting vaccine names. Model quantization enabled efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments. Findings demonstrate the potential of large language models in automating data extraction from emergency department notes, supporting efficient vaccine safety surveillance and early detection of emerging adverse events following immunization issues.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Benefiting from the strong ability in facilitating diverse data sources and supporting faithful reasoning, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been increasingly adopted in RAG systems, giving rise to KG-based RAG (KG-RAG) methods. Though RAG systems are widely applied in various applications, recent studies have also revealed its vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where malicious information injected into external knowledge sources can mislead the system into producing incorrect or harmful responses. However, these studies focus exclusively on RAG systems using unstructured textual data sources, leaving the security risks of KG-RAG largely unexplored, despite the fact that KGs present unique vulnerabilities due to their structured and editable nature. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of the security issue of KG-RAG methods through data poisoning attacks. To this end, we introduce a practical, stealthy attack setting that aligns with real-world implementation. We propose an attack strategy that first identifies adversarial target answers and then inserts perturbation triples to complete misleading inference chains in the KG, increasing the likelihood that KG-RAG methods retrieve and rely on these perturbations during generation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks and four recent KG-RAG methods, our attack strategy demonstrates strong effectiveness in degrading KG-RAG performance, even with minimal KG perturbations. In-depth analyses are also conducted to understand the safety threats within the internal stages of KG-RAG systems and to explore the robustness of LLMs against adversarial knowledge.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Integrating Perceptions: A Human-Centered Physical Safety Model for Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06700v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential to foster user trust and enable the broader adoption of robotic systems. Traditional safety models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses, trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types. Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models. Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role, emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change. These findings highlight the importance of adaptive, human-centered safety models that integrate both psychological and behavioral dimensions, offering a pathway toward more trustworthy and effective HRI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE RO-MAN 2025 Conference</p></details> |
