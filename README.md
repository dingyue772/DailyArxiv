| **[Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500 images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available: https://github.com/TruhnLab/VisionSemanticEntropy</p></details> |
| **[On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Hallucination Detection with Effective Rank-based Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08389v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers. Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules, thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and externally (different responses), providing a justification for using representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios, contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Mitigating Insertion Hallucination in Video-to-Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08078v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Hallucinations in Autonomous Vehicles: A Component-Agnostic Safety Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07749v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module, resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic. The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations, such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated, component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 15 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Semantics Tracing: A Framework for Explaining Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06107v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary contributions. First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic failures, we propose Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), a unified framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context (distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific commitment layer where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic associative pathway (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate, contextual pathway (akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks. Our framework's ability to quantify the coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation ($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the Transformer architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Image Editing with Hallucination-Aware Loss and Adaptive Tiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06295v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage. MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g., up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g., a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of Truth: Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04933v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables.

| **[When Models Lie, We Learn: Multilingual Span-Level Hallucination Detection with PsiloQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04849v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained, multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work, we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models -- and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets. Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained hallucination detection in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel hallucination classification framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05189v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses. Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective framework for improving model reliability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[TAG:Tangential Amplifying Guidance for Hallucination-Resistant Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04533v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[SECA: Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks for Eliciting LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04398v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

| **[Large Language Models Hallucination: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06265v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, their impressive fluency often comes at the cost of producing false or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Hallucination refers to the generation of content by an LLM that is fluent and syntactically correct but factually inaccurate or unsupported by external evidence. Hallucinations undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive review of research on hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on causes, detection, and mitigation. We first present a taxonomy of hallucination types and analyze their root causes across the entire LLM development lifecycle, from data collection and architecture design to inference. We further examine how hallucinations emerge in key natural language generation tasks. Building on this foundation, we introduce a structured taxonomy of detection approaches and another taxonomy of mitigation strategies. We also analyze the strengths and limitations of current detection and mitigation approaches and review existing evaluation benchmarks and metrics used to quantify LLMs hallucinations. Finally, we outline key open challenges and promising directions for future research, providing a foundation for the development of more truthful and trustworthy LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Language Model Hallucinations Through Distributional Correctness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04302v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common evaluation paradigms for language models focus on scoring single responses through accuracy metrics or proper scoring rules, failing to capture the full richness of a model's belief state. Recent work illustrates that language models hallucinate in-part because they are optimised to be good test-takers under binary scoring schemes that reward any answer over abstention. While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches, they ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for example between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward "I don't know" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness Score (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a model's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally distinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty expressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default range. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, DCS is demonstrated to offer a more nuanced and aligned evaluation paradigm that incentivises models to express genuine uncertainty rather than guessing. Adapting 12 existing evaluation benchmarks to DCS's variants and measuring performance on six language models reveals that for half of the tested benchmarks scores are negative across all tested models, indicating significant tendencies towards hallucination.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |

While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to emnlp2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Reason for Hallucination Span Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02173v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.</p></details> |  |

We present HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and (iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy (BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox Agentic AI using LP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09330v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Analysis of eVTOL Operations based on STPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09283v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft are expected to be quieter and more cost-effective than helicopters, offering major economic and social benefits through improved connectivity. Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation. The findings provide regulators with safety considerations that could shape new or updated regulations, compliance methods, and guidance materials for the safe deployment of eVTOLs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Safety into Orthogonal Subspace: Cost-Efficient and Performance-Preserving Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09004v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches. Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

This creates a fundamental tension between two competing challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content, and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets, demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Hallucinations in Autonomous Vehicles: A Component-Agnostic Safety Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07749v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module, resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic. The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations, such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated, component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 15 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Safety Evaluation in Generative Agent Social Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07709v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions: (1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans. Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75, 55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[SaFeR-VLM: Toward Safety-aware Fine-grained Reasoning in Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06871v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

| **[Decentralized CBF-based Safety Filters for Collision Avoidance of Cooperative Missile Systems with Input Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06846v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a decentralized safety filter for collision avoidance in multi-agent aerospace interception scenarios. The approach leverages robust control barrier functions (RCBFs) to guarantee forward invariance of safety sets under bounded inputs and high-relative-degree dynamics. Each effector executes its nominal cooperative guidance command, while a local quadratic program (QP) modifies the input only when necessary. Event-triggered activation based on range and zero-effort miss (ZEM) criteria ensures scalability by restricting active constraints to relevant neighbors. To resolve feasibility issues from simultaneous constraints, a slack-variable relaxation scheme is introduced that prioritizes critical agents in a Pareto-optimal manner. Simulation results in many-on-many interception scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains collision-free operation with minimal deviation from nominal guidance, providing a computationally efficient and scalable solution for safety-critical multi-agent aerospace systems.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[What You Don't Know Can Hurt You: How Well do Latent Safety Filters Understand Partially Observable Safety Constraints?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06492v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe control techniques, such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, provide principled methods for synthesizing safety-preserving robot policies but typically assume hand-designed state spaces and full observability. Recent work has relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state representations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that reconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from current observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are difficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as classification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate directly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that safety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask: when are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we examine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or manufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic safety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing failure itself. To predict such behaviors, we introduce a mutual information-based measure that identifies when observations fail to capture safety-relevant features. Finally, we propose a multimodal-supervised training strategy that shapes the latent state with additional sensory inputs during training, but requires no extra modalities at deployment, and validate our approach in simulation and on hardware with a Franka Research 3 manipulator preventing a pot of wax from overheating.</p></details> | 8 tables 6 figures |
| **[R3R: Decentralized Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance with Infinite-Horizon Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06436v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing decentralized methods for multi-agent motion planning lack formal, infinite-horizon safety guarantees, especially for communication-constrained systems. We present R3R, to our knowledge the first decentralized and asynchronous framework for multi-agent motion planning under distance-based communication constraints with infinite-horizon safety guarantees for systems of nonlinear agents. R3R's novelty lies in combining our gatekeeper safety framework with a geometric constraint called R-Boundedness, which together establish a formal link between an agent's communication radius and its ability to plan safely. We constrain trajectories to within a fixed planning radius that is a function of the agent's communication radius, which enables trajectories to be shown provably safe for all time, using only local information. Our algorithm is fully asynchronous, and ensures the forward invariance of these guarantees even in time-varying networks where agents asynchronously join, leave, and replan. We validate our approach in simulations of up to 128 Dubins vehicles, demonstrating 100% safety in dense, obstacle rich scenarios. Our results demonstrate that R3R's performance scales with agent density rather than problem size, providing a practical solution for scalable and provably safe multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, LaTeX; submitted to the American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Refusal Falls off a Cliff: How Safety Alignment Fails in Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06036v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as \textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights, we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Safety Challenge of World Models for Embodied AI Agents: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05865v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |

Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLM Safety Across Child Development Stages: A Simulated Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05484v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming part of tools used by children; however, existing benchmarks fail to capture how these models manage language, reasoning, and safety needs that are specific to various ages. We present ChildSafe, a benchmark that evaluates LLM safety through simulated child agents that embody four developmental stages. These agents, grounded in developmental psychology, enable a systematic study of child safety without the ethical implications of involving real children. ChildSafe assesses responses across nine safety dimensions (including privacy, misinformation, and emotional support) using age-weighted scoring in both sensitive and neutral contexts. Multi-turn experiments with multiple LLMs uncover consistent vulnerabilities that vary by simulated age, exposing shortcomings in existing alignment practices. By releasing agent templates, evaluation protocols, and an experimental corpus, we provide a reproducible framework for age-aware safety research. We encourage the community to expand this work with real child-centered data and studies, advancing the development of LLMs that are genuinely safe and developmentally aligned.</p></details> |  |
| **[NASP-T: A Fuzzy Neuro-Symbolic Transformer for Logic-Constrained Aviation Safety Report Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05451v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Agent Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05442v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust agent compared to the base model.</p></details> |  |

Backup control barrier functions (bCBFs) offer a structured approach to synthesizing safe controllers that are guaranteed to satisfy input bounds by leveraging the knowledge of a backup controller. While powerful, bCBFs require solving a high-dimensional quadratic program at run-time, which may be too costly for computationally-constrained systems such as aerospace vehicles. We propose an approach that optimally interpolates between a nominal controller and the backup controller, and we derive the solution to this optimization problem in closed form. We prove that this closed-form controller is guaranteed to be safe while obeying input bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a double integrator and a nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft example.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

The learning component combines an IQN-based distributional critic with a CVaR objective (IQN--CVaR--PPO) and a Tail-Coverage Controller that regulates quantile sampling through temperature tilting and tail boosting to stabilize small-$\alpha$ estimation. The safety component enforces discrete-time CBF inequalities together with domain-specific constraints -- ellipsoidal no-trade bands, box and rate limits, and a sign-consistency gate -- solved as a convex QP whose telemetry (active sets, tightness, rate utilization, gate scores, slack, and solver status) forms an auditable trail for governance. We provide guarantees of robust forward invariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation projection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state KL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity results for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region improvement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence under expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free, microstructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\to$ Dupire $\to$ VIX with ABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading central performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP is feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and incident workflows to support explainability and auditability. Limitations include reliance on synthetic data and simplified execution to isolate methodological contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages including appendices; 5 figures.

| **[Read the Scene, Not the Script: Outcome-Aware Safety for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04320v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and reproducible evaluation path.</p></details> |  |
