| **[Socratic-PRMBench: Benchmarking Process Reward Models with Systematic Reasoning Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23474v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation, Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration. Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future development of PRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discriminative Policy Optimization for Token-Level Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23363v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities. However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model (Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations. In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms, Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code and data are available at https://github.com/homzer/Q-RM.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Towards Reward Fairness in RLHF: From a Resource Allocation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23349v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Proximalized Preference Optimization for Diverse Feedback Types: A Decomposed Perspective on DPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23316v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses. As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination. In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise, binary and scalar feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIP-R1: Deep Inspection and Perception with RL Looking Through and Understanding Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23179v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant visual understanding capabilities, yet their fine-grained visual perception in complex real-world scenarios, such as densely crowded public areas, remains limited. Inspired by the recent success of reinforcement learning (RL) in both LLMs and MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modelings. First, we adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three step-by-step processes: 1) reasoning for understanding visual scenes, 2) observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3) decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward is designed to examine uncertain regions for the second observing process. It explicitly enables the model to inspect ambiguous areas, improving its ability to mitigate perceptual uncertainties. Third, we model a weighted precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We explore its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting of challenging real-world environments, such as densely crowded scenes. Built upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. It also outperforms various existing baseline models and supervised fine-tuning methods. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Study-Level Inference from Clinical Trial Papers via RL-based Numeric Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22928v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons. Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments. In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning. Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model. When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach -- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a 21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating systematic evidence synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Learning with Response Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22820v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation. While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Climb Carves Wisdom Deeper Than the Summit: On the Noisy Rewards in Learning to Reason](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22653v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast, our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques. Our code and scripts are available at https://github.com/trestad/Noisy-Rewards-in-Learning-to-Reason.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22338v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional RLHF optimizes language models with coarse, scalar rewards that mask the fine-grained reasons behind success or failure, leading to slow and opaque learning. Recent work augments RL with textual critiques through prompting or reflection, improving interpretability but leaving model parameters untouched. We introduce Text2Grad, a reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. Given human (or programmatic) critiques, Text2Grad aligns each feedback phrase with the relevant token spans, converts these alignments into differentiable reward signals, and performs gradient updates that directly refine the offending portions of the model's policy. This yields precise, feedback-conditioned adjustments instead of global nudges. Text2Grad is realized through three components: (1) a high-quality feedback-annotation pipeline that pairs critiques with token spans; (2) a fine-grained reward model that predicts span-level reward on answer while generating explanatory critiques; and (3) a span-level policy optimizer that back-propagates natural-language gradients. Across summarization, code generation, and question answering, Text2Grad consistently surpasses scalar-reward RL and prompt-only baselines, providing both higher task metrics and richer interpretability. Our results demonstrate that natural-language feedback, when converted to gradients, is a powerful signal for fine-grained policy optimization. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code for our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Text2Grad</p></details> |
| **[UI-Genie: A Self-Improving Approach for Iteratively Boosting MLLM-based Mobile GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21496v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research in https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie</p></details> |
| **[Policy Optimized Text-to-Image Pipeline Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21478v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators, adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally, we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Informativeness Optimization for Long-Form Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20825v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form question answering (LFQA) presents unique challenges for large language models, requiring the synthesis of coherent, paragraph-length answers. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution, existing research struggles with key limitations: the scarcity of high-quality training data for long-form generation, the compounding risk of hallucination in extended outputs, and the absence of reliable evaluation metrics for factual completeness. In this paper, we propose RioRAG, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that advances long-form RAG through reinforced informativeness optimization. Our approach introduces two fundamental innovations to address the core challenges. First, we develop an RL training paradigm of reinforced informativeness optimization that directly optimizes informativeness and effectively addresses the slow-thinking deficit in conventional RAG systems, bypassing the need for expensive supervised data. Second, we propose a nugget-centric hierarchical reward modeling approach that enables precise assessment of long-form answers through a three-stage process: extracting the nugget from every source webpage, constructing a nugget claim checklist, and computing rewards based on factual alignment. Extensive experiments on two LFQA benchmarks LongFact and RAGChecker demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RioRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[RRO: LLM Agent Optimization Through Rising Reward Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20737v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited extraordinary performance in a variety of tasks while it remains challenging for them to solve complex multi-step tasks as agents. In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[DriveRX: A Vision-Language Reasoning Model for Cross-Task Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20665v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires real-time, robust reasoning across perception, prediction, planning, and behavior. However, conventional end-to-end models fail to generalize in complex scenarios due to the lack of structured reasoning. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have been applied to driving tasks, but they typically rely on isolated modules and static supervision, limiting their ability to support multi-stage decision-making. We present AutoDriveRL, a unified training framework that formulates autonomous driving as a structured reasoning process over four core tasks. Each task is independently modeled as a vision-language question-answering problem and optimized using task-specific reward models, enabling fine-grained reinforcement signals at different reasoning stages. Within this framework, we train DriveRX, a cross-task reasoning VLM designed for real-time decision-making. DriveRX achieves strong performance on a public benchmark, outperforming GPT-4o in behavior reasoning and demonstrating robustness under complex or corrupted driving conditions. Our analysis further highlights the impact of vision encoder design and reward-guided reasoning compression. We will release the AutoDriveRL framework and the DriveRX model to support future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Pessimistic Reward Model in RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20556v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes `PET', a novel pessimistic reward fine-tuning method, to learn a pessimistic reward model robust against reward hacking in offline reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Traditional reward modeling techniques in RLHF train an imperfect reward model, on which a KL regularization plays a pivotal role in mitigating reward hacking when optimizing a policy. Such an intuition-based method still suffers from reward hacking, and the policies with large KL divergence from the dataset distribution are excluded during learning. In contrast, we show that when optimizing a policy on a pessimistic reward model fine-tuned through PET, reward hacking can be prevented without relying on any regularization. We test our methods on the standard TL;DR summarization dataset. We find that one can learn a high-quality policy on our pessimistic reward without using any regularization. Such a policy has a high KL divergence from the dataset distribution while having high performance in practice. In summary, our work shows the feasibility of learning a pessimistic reward model against reward hacking. The agent can greedily search for the policy with a high pessimistic reward without suffering from reward hacking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCAR: Shapley Credit Assignment for More Efficient RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20417v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely used technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet it often suffers from sparse reward signals, making effective credit assignment challenging. In typical setups, the reward model provides a single scalar score for an entire generated sequence, offering little insight into which token or span-level decisions were responsible for the outcome. To address this, we propose Shapley Credit Assignment Rewards (SCAR), a novel method that leverages Shapley values in cooperative game theory. SCAR distributes the total sequence-level reward among constituent tokens or text spans based on their principled marginal contributions. This creates dense reward signals, crucially, without necessitating the training of auxiliary critique models or recourse to fine-grained human annotations at intermediate generation stages. Unlike prior dense reward methods, SCAR offers a game-theoretic foundation for fair credit attribution. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SCAR preserves the original optimal policy, and empirically, across diverse tasks including sentiment control, text summarization, and instruction tuning, we show that SCAR converges significantly faster and achieves higher final reward scores compared to standard RLHF and attention-based dense reward baselines. Our findings suggest that SCAR provides a more effective and theoretically sound method for credit assignment in RLHF, leading to more efficient alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20415v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by generating symbolic reasoning trajectories and select the high-quality ones using a process reward model automatically tuned based on Monte Carlo estimation. The trajectories are then employed via fine-tuning methods to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on logical reasoning benchmarks such as FOLIO and LogicAsker show the effectiveness of the proposed method with large gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of symbolically-guided process supervision in alleviating the effect of memorization on LLM reasoning.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[DreamPRM: Domain-Reweighted Process Reward Model for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20241v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complicated tasks. Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an effective data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses other data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Domain Explainability of Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20088v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference mechanisms, such as human preference, LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ), and reward models, are central to aligning and evaluating large language models (LLMs). Yet, the underlying concepts that drive these preferences remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a fully automated method for generating local and global concept-based explanations of preferences across multiple domains. Our method utilizes an LLM to identify concepts that distinguish between chosen and rejected responses, and to represent them with concept-based vectors. To model the relationships between concepts and preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable. Additionally, we assess explanations in two application-driven settings. First, guiding LLM outputs with concepts from LaaJ explanations yields responses that those judges consistently prefer. Second, prompting LaaJs with concepts explaining humans improves their preference predictions. Together, our work establishes a new paradigm for explainability in the era of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time Alignment in Continuous Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20081v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models with human feedback at inference time has received increasing attention due to its flexibility. Existing methods rely on generating multiple responses from the base policy for search using a reward model, which can be considered as searching in a discrete response space. However, these methods struggle to explore informative candidates when the base policy is weak or the candidate set is small, resulting in limited effectiveness. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose Simple Energy Adaptation ($\textbf{SEA}$), a simple yet effective algorithm for inference-time alignment. In contrast to expensive search over the discrete space, SEA directly adapts original responses from the base policy toward the optimal one via gradient-based sampling in continuous latent space. Specifically, SEA formulates inference as an iterative optimization procedure on an energy function over actions in the continuous space defined by the optimal policy, enabling simple and effective alignment. For instance, despite its simplicity, SEA outperforms the second-best baseline with a relative improvement of up to $ \textbf{77.51%}$ on AdvBench and $\textbf{16.36%}$ on MATH.

However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixelThink: Towards Efficient Chain-of-Pixel Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23727v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reasoning segmentation approaches typically fine-tune multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using image-text pairs and corresponding mask labels. However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking - producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity. This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://PixelThink.github.io</p></details> |
| **[SocialMaze: A Benchmark for Evaluating Social Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23713v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others' mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However, there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues; and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/SocialMaze</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/xzx34/SocialMaze</p></details> |
| **[Let's Reason Formally: Natural-Formal Hybrid Reasoning Enhances LLM's Math Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23703v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Reason Abstractly Over Math Word Problems Without CoT? Disentangling Abstract Formulation From Arithmetic Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23701v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation. These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23678v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://visually-grounded-rl.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Fortune: Formula-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Table Reasoning in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23667v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems. While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[How does Transformer Learn Implicit Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23653v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization, followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Chain of Thought Enables Parallel Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23648v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex. Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Reasoning Models More Prone to Hallucination?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23646v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks, whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1) We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Table-R1: Inference-Time Scaling for Table Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23621v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a 7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization, as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: A Mobile Assistant with Persistent Finite State Machines for Recovery Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23596v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error recovery.</p></details> |  |

Current DNA foundation models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations. We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time, deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM). This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning, guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction - where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction, BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from genomic data.

However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens, causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain (Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention. Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection. Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing hallucinations. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Liar406/Look_Again.</p></details> |  |

While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2) intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks.

While recent T2I models have made impressive progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense, mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

| **[Socratic-PRMBench: Benchmarking Process Reward Models with Systematic Reasoning Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23474v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation, Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration. Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future development of PRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity-Aware Policy Optimization for Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23433v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models. This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples. Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5 percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while generating more diverse and robust solutions.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models, GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable, and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
