| **[Energy-Guided Decoding for Object Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07731v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes'' ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets. Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; to be submitted to AAAI-26 after reviews</p></details> |
| **[INTER: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by Interaction Guidance Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05056v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content. This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced, cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings, we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Tri-Space Tension: ARC-Guided Hallucination Modeling and Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04946v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent "hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We withdraw this paper due to significant visualization errors in Figure 3 and 5 that affect the correctness of our core modeling claims and may cause misinterpretation.

| **[ReLoop: "Seeing Twice and Thinking Backwards" via Closed-loop Training to Mitigate Hallucinations in Multimodal understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04943v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,6 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

However, hallucination issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential. Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Level Hallucination Detection via Variance in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04137v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations, confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations. Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[KEA Explain: Explanations of Hallucinations using Graph Kernel Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03847v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a foundation for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using multi-agent architecture to mitigate the risk of LLM hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01446v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving customer service quality and response time are critical factors for maintaining customer loyalty and increasing a company's market share. While adopting emerging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming a necessity to achieve these goals, the risk of hallucination remains a major challenge. In this paper, we present a multi-agent system to handle customer requests sent via SMS. This system integrates LLM based agents with fuzzy logic to mitigate hallucination risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ONLY: One-Layer Intervention Sufficiently Mitigates Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00898v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses. Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However, these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding, enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort and computational cost.

However, most of the research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3 - Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, SemEval-2025 Task 3, ACL</p></details> |
| **[CAI: Caption-Sensitive Attention Intervention for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23590v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in interpreting visual information, they frequently produce content that deviates from visual information, leading to object hallucination. To tackle this, recent works mostly depend on expensive manual annotations and training cost, or significantly increase inference time. In this work, we observe that LVLMs' attention to visual information is significantly stronger when answering caption queries compared to non-caption queries. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose Caption-sensitive Attention Intervention (CAI), a training-free, plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that leverages the attention activation pattern in response to caption queries to enhance LVLMs' visual perception capability. Extensive experimental results across four benchmarks covering both discriminative and generative tasks, demonstrate that CAI achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) hallucination mitigating performance only with minimal additional inference cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCo: Reminder Composition Mitigates Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22636v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e., generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled. Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions, we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve improved results for each one.</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21546v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://plan-lab.github.io/hallusegbench/</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Hallucination for Self-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20342v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis; it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D, AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained action dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |
| **[Seeing is Believing? Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correcting Hallucinations in News Summaries: Exploration of Self-Correcting LLM Methods with External Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19607v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations -- factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FEVER @ ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual hallucination detection in large vision-language models via evidential conflict](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19513v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective, overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset, which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances, scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5, mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics, achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination Detection with Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22486v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions through retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a vectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses. However, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in practical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of ground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper proposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify responses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized database. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and utilizing the probability of generating "Yes" tokens from the outputs of multiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context, hallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through experiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers, and contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences. The results demonstrate a 10\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct responses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language models can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a scalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Set-Based Control Barrier Functions and Safety Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07805v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High performance and formal safety guarantees are common requirements for industrial control applications. Control barrier function (CBF) methods provide a systematic approach to the modularization of safety and performance. However, the design of such CBFs can be challenging, which limits their applicability to large-scale or data-driven systems. This paper introduces the concept of a set-based CBF for linear systems with convex constraints. By leveraging control invariant sets from reachability analysis and predictive control, the set-based CBF is defined implicitly through the minimal scaling of such a set to contain the current system state. This approach enables the development of implicit, data-driven, and high-dimensional CBF representations. The paper demonstrates the design of a safety filter using set-based CBFs, which is suitable for real-time implementations and learning-based approximations to reduce online computational demands. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through comprehensive simulations on a high-dimensional mass-spring-damper system and a motion control task, and it is validated experimentally using an electric drive application with short sampling times, highlighting its practical benefits for safety-critical control.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities. Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform future research and drive the development of more secure models.</p></details> | 24 pages |

The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter model outperformed other models in its accuracy of extracting vaccine names. Model quantization enabled efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments.

| **[Integrating Perceptions: A Human-Centered Physical Safety Model for Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06700v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential to foster user trust and enable the broader adoption of robotic systems. Traditional safety models primarily rely on sensor-based measures, such as relative distance and velocity, to assess physical safety. However, these models often fail to capture subjective safety perceptions, which are shaped by individual traits and contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized general safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety by incorporating a personalization parameter, $\rho$, into the safety measurement framework to account for individual differences in safety perception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a simulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot behavior influence perceived safety. Our results show that $\rho$ effectively captures meaningful individual differences, driven by affective responses, trust in task consistency, and clustering into distinct user types. Specifically, our findings confirm that predictable and consistent robot behavior as well as the elicitation of positive emotional states, significantly enhance perceived safety. Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of user types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models. Notably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated exposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role, emphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change.

From Scene Understanding towards Road Safety: A Survey of Vision-driven Datasets and Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06513v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in traffic scenarios and comprehensively analyzes available vision-driven tasks and datasets. Compared to existing surveys that focus on isolated domains, our taxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the aim of providing information on standards unification and resource optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 52 figures, 2 large tables (divided into 5), 73 datatsets, 35 tasks</p></details> |

CMVs account for numerous traffic incidents, so monitoring CMV safety and safety inspections is essential for ensuring safe and efficient highway movement. This paper presents the development and real-world application of CMV dashboards designed under the guidance of CMV safety enforcement professionals from the Maryland State Police (MSP), the Maryland Department of Transportation - State Highway Administration (MDOT - SHA), and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to enable intuitive and efficient analysis of CMV safety performance measures. First, three CMV safety dashboards enable CMV safety professionals to identify sites with a history of safety performance issues. A supplemental dashboard automates the analysis of CMV enforcement initiatives using the same performance measures. These performance measures are based on CMV probe vehicle speeds, inspection/citation data from Truck Weigh and Inspection Stations (TWIS), patrolling enforcement, and Virtual Weigh Stations (VWS). The authors collaborated with MSP to identify a portion of I-81 in Maryland, susceptible to improvement from targeted CMV enforcement. The supplemental enforcement assessment dashboard was employed to evaluate the impact of enforcement, including the post-enforcement halo effect. The results of the post-enforcement evaluation were mixed, indicating a need for more fine-grained citation data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2025.

| **[OpenAgentSafety: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Real-World AI Agent Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06134v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings, but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories. Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites, and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors. Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7% with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[RabakBench: Scaling Human Annotations to Construct Localized Multilingual Safety Benchmarks for Low-Resource Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05980v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label - semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments. The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and evaluation code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal Representations for Fine-grained Multi-label Critical View of Safety Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05007v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations. This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained, binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts. By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts, boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models to specialized surgical tasks.

It processes text, images, and video with a one-million-token context window, enabling analysis of large codebases, 400-page documents, and 90-minute videos in a single prompt. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of Nova Premier's critical risk profile under the Frontier Model Safety Framework. Evaluations target three high-risk domains -- Chemical, Biological, Radiological & Nuclear (CBRN), Offensive Cyber Operations, and Automated AI R&D -- and combine automated benchmarks, expert red-teaming, and uplift studies to determine whether the model exceeds release thresholds. We summarize our methodology and report core findings. Based on this evaluation, we find that Nova Premier is safe for public release as per our commitments made at the 2025 Paris AI Safety Summit. We will continue to enhance our safety evaluation and mitigation pipelines as new risks and capabilities associated with frontier models are identified.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-Emergent Misalignment: How Narrow Fine-Tuning Erodes Safety Alignment in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03662v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms. Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that preserve intended behavior across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Uncertainty Quantification for Runtime Safety Assurance Using Causal Risk Analysis and Operational Design Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03515v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the runtime safety of autonomous systems remains challenging due to deep learning components' inherent uncertainty and their sensitivity to environmental changes. In this paper, we propose an enhancement of traditional uncertainty quantification by explicitly incorporating environmental conditions using risk-based causal analysis. We leverage Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) and fault tree modeling to identify critical operational conditions affecting system functionality. These conditions, together with uncertainties from the data and model, are integrated into a unified Bayesian Network (BN). At runtime, this BN is instantiated using real-time environmental observations to infer a probabilistic distribution over the safety estimation. This distribution enables the computation of both expected performance and its associated variance, providing a dynamic and context-aware measure of uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach through a case study of the Object Detection (OD) component in an Automated Valet Parking (AVP).</p></details> |  |
| **[MISC: Minimal Intervention Shared Control with Guaranteed Safety under Non-Convex Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02438v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics, teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable. To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66 participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Addressing these issues, this study develops an AI-driven framework to enhance maritime training by objectively assessing trainee performance through visual focus tracking, speech recognition, and stress detection, improving readiness for high-risk scenarios. The system integrates AI techniques, including visual focus determination using eye tracking, pupil dilation analysis, and computer vision; communication analysis through a maritime-specific speech-to-text model and natural language processing; communication correctness using large language models; and mental stress detection via vocal pitch. Models were evaluated on data from simulated maritime scenarios with seafarers exposed to controlled high-stress events. The AI algorithms achieved high accuracy, with ~92% for visual detection, ~91% for maritime speech recognition, and ~90% for stress detection, surpassing existing benchmarks. The system provides insights into visual attention, adherence to communication checklists, and stress levels under demanding conditions. This study demonstrates how AI can transform maritime training by delivering objective performance analytics, enabling personalized feedback, and improving preparedness for real-world operational challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and Presented at 11th International Maritime Science Conference</p></details> |
| **[LLM-based Realistic Safety-Critical Driving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01264v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Agent Safety via Causal Influence Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00979v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2) guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3) iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in both code execution and mobile device control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 Findings, Source code: https://github.com/HahmDY/causal_influence_prompting.git</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00971v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 11 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Is It Safe To Learn And Share? On Psychological Safety and Social Learning in (Agile) Communities of Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01065v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As hybrid, distributed, and asynchronous work models become more prevalent, continuous learning in Agile Software Development (ASD) gains renewed importance. Communities of Practice (CoPs) are increasingly adopted to support social learning beyond formal education, often relying on virtual communication. Psychological safety, a prerequisite for effective learning, remains insufficiently understood in these settings. This mixed-methods study investigates psychological safety within Agile CoPs through survey data from 143 participants. Results indicate that psychological safety is significantly lower in online interactions compared to face-to-face settings. Moreover, low psychological safety reduces participants' intent to continue contributing and avoidance of interpersonal risk. No significant differences emerged based on gender, community seniority, or content creation activity. However, differences by role and age group suggest potential generational or role-related effects. Thematic analysis revealed exclusionary behavior, negative interaction patterns, and hostility as primary threats to psychological safety, often reinforced by tribalism and specific community dynamics. Suggested interventions include establishing explicit norms, structured facilitation, and active moderation. The findings were validated through member checking with 30 participants. This study provides a comparative perspective on interaction modalities and offers practical guidance for organizers seeking to cultivate inclusive, high-impact CoPs and similarly structured virtual or hybrid work environments.</p></details> |  |

However, they typically do not offer verifiable results and lack confidentiality for model IP and benchmark datasets. We propose Attestable Audits, which run inside Trusted Execution Environments and enable users to verify interaction with a compliant AI model. Our work protects sensitive data even when model provider and auditor do not trust each other. This addresses verification challenges raised in recent AI governance frameworks.
