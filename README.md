| **[Seedream 3.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11346v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Seedream 3.0, a high-performance Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model. We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seedr...</summary><p>Seedream 3.0 Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[InstructEngine: Instruction-driven Text-to-Image Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10329v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human/AI Feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) has been extensively utilized for preference alignment of text-to-image models. Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components. A win rate of over 50% in human reviews also proves that InstructEngine better aligns with human preferences.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Efficient Process Reward Model Training via Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10559v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision to large language models (LLMs), but scaling up training data annotation remains challenging for both humans and LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose an active learning approach, ActPRM, which proactively selects the most uncertain samples for training, substantially reducing labeling costs. During training, we use the PRM to estimate uncertainty after the forward pass, retaining only highly uncertain data. A capable yet costly reasoning model then labels this data. Then we compute the loss with respect to the labels and update the PRM's weights. We compare ActPRM vs. vanilla fine-tuning, on a pool-based active learning setting, demonstrating that ActPRM reduces 50% annotation, but achieving the comparable or even better performance. Beyond annotation efficiency, we further advance the actively trained PRM by filtering over 1M+ math reasoning trajectories with ActPRM, retaining 60% of the data. A subsequent training on this selected dataset yields a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) PRM on ProcessBench (75.0%) and PRMBench (65.5%) compared with same sized models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PRM-BAS: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning through PRM-guided Beam Annealing Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10222v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work increasingly focuses on improving the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among existing methods, Process Reward Models (PRMs) stand out for offering dense, step-wise supervision to guide intermediate reasoning. However, how to effectively integrate PRMs into search strategies remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce PRM-BAS (PRM-Guided Beam Annealing Search), a lightweight approach for PRM-guided reasoning that dynamically adjusts beam size -- starting with a broader search space and gradually narrowing it as contextual information accumulates, thereby balancing performance and efficiency. We further propose a unified framework for data construction and PRM training. Specifically, we construct the PRM-BAS-300k dataset by selecting 300k questions from existing datasets and performing rollouts at each step to estimate the probability of reaching a correct final answer. The PRM is then trained using a combination of value loss for absolute action quality and rank loss for relative action quality. Extensive experiments on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PRM-BAS significantly improves reasoning performance while maintaining low computational cost. Moreover, it generalizes well across different model scales and architectures, showcasing strong robustness and plug-and-play capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Prompting to Alignment: A Generative Framework for Query Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10208v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern search systems, search engines often suggest relevant queries to users through various panels or components, helping refine their information needs. Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues. Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications. Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference. Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation. Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list. Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reasoning Translation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10187v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various complex tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHARM: Calibrating Reward Models With Chatbot Arena Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10045v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback by serving as proxies for human preferences in aligning large language models. In this paper, we identify a model preference bias in RMs, where they systematically assign disproportionately high scores to responses from certain policy models. This bias distorts ranking evaluations and leads to unfair judgments. To address this issue, we propose a calibration method named CHatbot Arena calibrated Reward Modeling (CHARM) that leverages Elo scores from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard to mitigate RM overvaluation. We also introduce a Mismatch Degree metric to measure this preference bias. Our approach is computationally efficient, requiring only a small preference dataset for continued training of the RM. We conduct extensive experiments on reward model benchmarks and human preference alignment. Results demonstrate that our calibrated RMs (1) achieve improved evaluation accuracy on RM-Bench and the Chat-Hard domain of RewardBench, and (2) exhibit a stronger correlation with human preferences by producing scores more closely aligned with Elo rankings. By mitigating model preference bias, our method provides a generalizable and efficient solution for building fairer and more reliable reward models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Anime Video Generation with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10044v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anime video generation faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of anime data and unusual motion patterns, leading to issues such as motion distortion and flickering artifacts, which result in misalignment with human preferences. Existing reward models, designed primarily for real-world videos, fail to capture the unique appearance and consistency requirements of anime. In this work, we propose a pipeline to enhance anime video generation by leveraging human feedback for better alignment. Specifically, we construct the first multi-dimensional reward dataset for anime videos, comprising 30k human-annotated samples that incorporating human preferences for both visual appearance and visual consistency. Based on this, we develop AnimeReward, a powerful reward model that employs specialized vision-language models for different evaluation dimensions to guide preference alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Gap-Aware Preference Optimization (GAPO), a novel training method that explicitly incorporates preference gaps into the optimization process, enhancing alignment performance and efficiency. Extensive experiment results show that AnimeReward outperforms existing reward models, and the inclusion of GAPO leads to superior alignment in both quantitative benchmarks and human evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing anime video quality. Our dataset and code will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[FLoRA: Sample-Efficient Preference-based RL via Low-Rank Style Adaptation of Reward Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10002v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) is a suitable approach for style adaptation of pre-trained robotic behavior: adapting the robot's policy to follow human user preferences while still being able to perform the original task. However, collecting preferences for the adaptation process in robotics is often challenging and time-consuming. In this work we explore the adaptation of pre-trained robots in the low-preference-data regime. We show that, in this regime, recent adaptation approaches suffer from catastrophic reward forgetting (CRF), where the updated reward model overfits to the new preferences, leading the agent to become unable to perform the original task. To mitigate CRF, we propose to enhance the original reward model with a small number of parameters (low-rank matrices) responsible for modeling the preference adaptation. Our evaluation shows that our method can efficiently and effectively adjust robotic behavior to human preferences across simulation benchmark tasks and multiple real-world robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA).

| **[Learning from Reference Answers: Versatile Language Model Alignment without Binary Human Preference Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09895v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Iterative Self-Training for Code Generation via Reinforced Re-Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09643v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality code that solves complex programming tasks is challenging, especially with current decoder-based models that produce highly stochastic outputs. In code generation, even minor errors can easily break the entire solution. Leveraging multiple sampled solutions can significantly improve the overall output quality. One effective way to enhance code generation is by pairing a code generation model with a reranker model, which selects the best solution from the generated samples. We propose a novel iterative self-training approach for self-training reranker models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), aimed at improving both reranking accuracy and the overall code generation process. Unlike traditional PPO approaches, where the focus is on optimizing a generative model with a reward model, our approach emphasizes the development of a robust reward/reranking model. This model improves the quality of generated code through reranking and addresses problems and errors that the reward model might overlook during PPO alignment with the reranker. Our method iteratively refines the training dataset by re-evaluating outputs, identifying high-scoring negative examples, and incorporating them into the training loop, that boosting model performance. Our evaluation on the MultiPL-E dataset demonstrates that our 13.4B parameter model outperforms a 33B model in code generation quality while being three times faster. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 and surpasses it in one programming language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Genius: A Generalizable and Purely Unsupervised Self-Training Framework For Advanced Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08672v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancing LLM reasoning skills has captivated wide interest. However, current post-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome supervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability and high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without the need for external supervision. We introduce a generalizable and purely unsupervised self-training framework, named Genius. Without external auxiliary, Genius requires to seek the optimal response sequence in a stepwise manner and optimize the LLM. To explore the potential steps and exploit the optimal ones, Genius introduces a stepwise foresight re-sampling strategy to sample and estimate the step value by simulating future outcomes. Further, we recognize that the unsupervised setting inevitably induces the intrinsic noise and uncertainty. To provide a robust optimization, we propose an advantage-calibrated optimization (ACO) loss function to mitigate estimation inconsistencies. Combining these techniques together, Genius provides an advanced initial step towards self-improve LLM reasoning with general queries and without supervision, revolutionizing reasoning scaling laws given the vast availability of general queries. The code will be released at https://github.com/xufangzhi/Genius.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Predicting the next word in an existing text has turned out to be a powerful signal, at least at scale. But there are signs that we are running out of this resource. In recent months, interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus, both for "alignment" (with a reward model judging the quality of instruction following attempts) and for improving "reasoning" (process- and outcome-based verifiers judging reasoning steps). In this paper, we explore to what extent synthetic interaction in what we call Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can provide a learning signal, and how this signal can be used. We introduce an environment for producing such interaction data (with the help of a Large Language Model as counterpart to the learner model), both offline and online. We investigate the effects of supervised fine-tuning on this data, as well as reinforcement learning setups such as DPO, and GRPO; showing that all of these approaches achieve some improvements in in-domain games, but only GRPO demonstrates the ability to generalise to out-of-domain games as well as retain competitive performance in reference-based tasks. We release the framework and the baseline training setups in the hope that this can foster research in this promising new direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code: https://github.com/lm-playpen/playpen Please send correspodence to: lm-playschool@googlegroups.com</p></details> |
| **[Plan-and-Refine: Diverse and Comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07794v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the limitations of (retrieval-augmented) large language models (LLMs) in generating diverse and comprehensive responses, and introduces the Plan-and-Refine (P&R) framework based on a two phase system design. In the global exploration phase, P&R generates a diverse set of plans for the given input, where each plan consists of a list of diverse query aspects with corresponding additional descriptions. This phase is followed by a local exploitation phase that generates a response proposal for the input query conditioned on each plan and iteratively refines the proposal for improving the proposal quality. Finally, a reward model is employed to select the proposal with the highest factuality and coverage. We conduct our experiments based on the ICAT evaluation methodology--a recent approach for answer factuality and comprehensiveness evaluation. Experiments on the two diverse information seeking benchmarks adopted from non-factoid question answering and TREC search result diversification tasks demonstrate that P&R significantly outperforms baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% improvement on the ANTIQUE dataset and a 15.41% improvement on the TREC dataset. Furthermore, a smaller scale user study confirms the substantial efficacy of the P&R framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Slop to AI-Polish? Aligning Language Models through Edit-Based Writing Rewards and Test-time Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07532v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[Benchmarking Multimodal CoT Reward Model Stepwise by Visual Program](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06606v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reward signal usage for Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable. However, significant challenges exist when transitioning reward signal to the multimodal domain, including labor-intensive annotations, over-reliance on one-step rewards, and inadequate evaluation. To address these issues, we propose SVIP, a novel approach to train a step-level multi-dimensional Chain-of-Thought~(CoT) reward model automatically. It generates code for solving visual tasks and transforms the analysis of code blocks into the evaluation of CoT step as training samples. Then, we train SVIP-Reward model using a multi-head attention mechanism called TriAtt-CoT. The advantages of SVIP-Reward are evident throughout the entire process of MLLM. We also introduce a benchmark for CoT reward model training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that SVIP-Reward improves MLLM performance across training and inference-time scaling, yielding better results on benchmarks while reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Training of Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06141v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling has emerged as a promising approach for the scalable alignment of language models. However, contemporary reward models (RMs) often lack robustness, awarding high rewards to low-quality, out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This can lead to reward hacking, where policies exploit unintended shortcuts to maximize rewards, undermining alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce Adv-RM, a novel adversarial training framework that automatically identifies adversarial examples -- responses that receive high rewards from the target RM but are OOD and of low quality. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Adv-RM trains a policy to generate adversarial examples that reliably expose vulnerabilities in large state-of-the-art reward models such as Nemotron 340B RM. Incorporating these adversarial examples into the reward training process improves the robustness of RMs, mitigating reward hacking and enhancing downstream performance in RLHF. We demonstrate that Adv-RM significantly outperforms conventional RM training, increasing stability and enabling more effective RLHF training in both synthetic and real-data settings.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Information-Theoretic Reward Decomposition for Generalizable RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06020v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalizable reward model is crucial in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as it enables correctly evaluating unseen prompt-response pairs. However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done during internships at Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom</p></details> |
| **[Right Question is Already Half the Answer: Fully Unsupervised LLM Reasoning Incentivization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05812v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning, existing methods to enhance reasoning ability predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data after pre-training. However, these approaches critically depend on external supervisions--such as human labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form commonsense reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, EMPO boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves truthfulness accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Instruct from 87.16\% to 97.25\% on TruthfulQA.</p></details> | Ongoing work |
| **[COIG-P: A High-Quality and Large-Scale Chinese Preference Dataset for Alignment with Human Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05535v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench \citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/COIG-P.</p></details> |  |

| **[FLIP Reasoning Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12256v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past years, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated how AI can solve many perception and generation tasks, such as image classification and text writing, yet reasoning remains a challenge. This paper introduces the FLIP dataset, a benchmark for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities based on human verification tasks on the Idena blockchain. FLIP challenges present users with two orderings of 4 images, requiring them to identify the logically coherent one. By emphasizing sequential reasoning, visual storytelling, and common sense, FLIP provides a unique testbed for multimodal AI systems. Our experiments evaluate state-of-the-art models, leveraging both vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Results reveal that even the best open-sourced and closed-sourced models achieve maximum accuracies of 75.5% and 77.9%, respectively, in zero-shot settings, compared to human performance of 95.3%. Captioning models aid reasoning models by providing text descriptions of images, yielding better results than when using the raw images directly, 69.6% vs. 75.2% for Gemini 1.5 Pro. Combining the predictions from 15 models in an ensemble increases the accuracy to 85.2%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing reasoning models and the need for robust multimodal benchmarks like FLIP. The full codebase and dataset will be available at https://github.com/aplesner/FLIP-Reasoning-Challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at First Workshop on Open Science for Foundation Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[d1: Scaling Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12216v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO.

| **[Reasoning-Based AI for Startup Evaluation (R.A.I.S.E.): A Memory-Augmented, Multi-Step Decision Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12090v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework that bridges the gap between the interpretability of decision trees and the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to predict startup success. Our approach leverages chain-of-thought prompting to generate detailed reasoning logs, which are subsequently distilled into structured, human-understandable logical rules. The pipeline integrates multiple enhancements - efficient data ingestion, a two-step refinement process, ensemble candidate sampling, simulated reinforcement learning scoring, and persistent memory - to ensure both stable decision-making and transparent output. Experimental evaluations on curated startup datasets demonstrate that our combined pipeline improves precision by 54% from 0.225 to 0.346 and accuracy by 50% from 0.46 to 0.70 compared to a standalone OpenAI o3 model. Notably, our model achieves over 2x the precision of a random classifier (16%). By combining state-of-the-art AI reasoning with explicit rule-based explanations, our method not only augments traditional decision-making processes but also facilitates expert intervention and continuous policy refinement. This work lays the foundation for the implementation of interpretable LLM-powered decision frameworks in high-stakes investment environments and other domains that require transparent and data-driven insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding Flawed Fictions: Evaluating Complex Reasoning in Language Models via Plot Hole Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11900v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stories are a fundamental aspect of human experience. Engaging deeply with stories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break the internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning skills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract thinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning, and theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate, interpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency and deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we propose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language understanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel algorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written stories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot hole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to contamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless of the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as story length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and story generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and 100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written originals.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Could Thinking Multilingually Empower LLM Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11833v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous work indicates that large language models exhibit a significant "English bias", i.e. they often perform better when tasks are presented in English. Interestingly, we have observed that using certain other languages in reasoning tasks can yield better performance than English. However, this phenomenon remains under-explored. In this paper, we explore the upper bound of harnessing multilingualism in reasoning tasks, suggesting that multilingual reasoning promises significantly (by nearly 10 Acc@$k$ points) and robustly (tolerance for variations in translation quality and language choice) higher upper bounds than English-only reasoning. Besides analyzing the reason behind the upper bound and challenges in reaching it, we also find that common answer selection methods cannot achieve this upper bound, due to their limitations and biases. These insights could pave the way for future research aimed at fully harnessing the potential of multilingual reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Climbing the Ladder of Reasoning: What LLMs Can-and Still Can't-Solve after SFT?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11741v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have significantly improved language models' performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, even when models are trained at a small scale. However, the specific capabilities enhanced through such fine-tuning remain poorly understood. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of model performance on the AIME24 dataset to understand how reasoning capabilities evolve. We discover a ladder-like structure in problem difficulty, categorize questions into four tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extremely Hard (Exh)), and identify the specific requirements for advancing between tiers. We find that progression from Easy to Medium tier requires adopting an R1 reasoning style with minimal SFT (500-1K instances), while Hard-level questions suffer from frequent model's errors at each step of the reasoning chain, with accuracy plateauing at around 65% despite logarithmic scaling. Exh-level questions present a fundamentally different challenge; they require unconventional problem-solving skills that current models uniformly struggle with. Additional findings reveal that carefully curated small-scale datasets offer limited advantage-scaling dataset size proves far more effective. Our analysis provides a clearer roadmap for advancing language model capabilities in mathematical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) applied to LLMs shows promise, progress is significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale training data that is sufficiently challenging, possesses verifiable answer formats suitable for RL, and is free from contamination with evaluation benchmarks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepMath-103K, a new, large-scale dataset comprising approximately 103K mathematical problems, specifically designed to train advanced reasoning models via RL. DeepMath-103K is curated through a rigorous pipeline involving source analysis, stringent decontamination against numerous benchmarks, and filtering for high difficulty (primarily Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding existing open resources in challenge. Each problem includes a verifiable final answer, enabling rule-based RL, and three distinct R1-generated solutions suitable for diverse training paradigms like supervised fine-tuning or distillation. Spanning a wide range of mathematical topics, DeepMath-103K promotes the development of generalizable reasoning. We demonstrate that models trained on DeepMath-103K achieve significant improvements on challenging mathematical benchmarks, validating its effectiveness. We release DeepMath-103K publicly to facilitate community progress in building more capable AI reasoning systems: https://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath.</p></details> | WIP |
| **[Teaching Large Language Models to Reason through Learning and Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11364v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kimina-Prover Preview: Towards Large Formal Reasoning Models with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11354v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Kimina-Prover Preview, a large language model that pioneers a novel reasoning-driven exploration paradigm for formal theorem proving, as showcased in this preview release. Trained with a large-scale reinforcement learning pipeline from Qwen2.5-72B, Kimina-Prover demonstrates strong performance in Lean 4 proof generation by employing a structured reasoning pattern we term \textit{formal reasoning pattern}. This approach allows the model to emulate human problem-solving strategies in Lean, iteratively generating and refining proof steps. Kimina-Prover sets a new state-of-the-art on the miniF2F benchmark, reaching 80.7% with pass@8192. Beyond improved benchmark performance, our work yields several key insights: (1) Kimina-Prover exhibits high sample efficiency, delivering strong results even with minimal sampling (pass@1) and scaling effectively with computational budget, stemming from its unique reasoning pattern and RL training; (2) we demonstrate clear performance scaling with model size, a trend previously unobserved for neural theorem provers in formal mathematics; (3) the learned reasoning style, distinct from traditional search algorithms, shows potential to bridge the gap between formal verification and informal mathematical intuition. We open source distilled versions with 1.5B and 7B parameters of Kimina-Prover</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11343v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge: An Ever-Scaling Reasoning Benchmark for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11239v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is the fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid progress of LLMs, there are two main issues of current benchmarks: i) these benchmarks can be crushed in a short time (less than 1 year), and ii) these benchmarks may be easily hacked. To handle these issues, we propose the ever-scalingness for building the benchmarks which are uncrushable, unhackable, auto-verifiable and general. This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult. We believe that NPPC is the first ever-scaling reasoning benchmark, serving as the uncrushable and unhackable testbed for LLMs toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary work, 10 pages for main text</p></details> |
| **[3DAffordSplat: Efficient Affordance Reasoning with 3D Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11218v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D affordance reasoning is essential in associating human instructions with the functional regions of 3D objects, facilitating precise, task-oriented manipulations in embodied AI. However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing multimodal analogical reasoning with Logic Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11190v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated their capabilities across a variety of tasks. However, automatically extracting implicit knowledge from natural language remains a significant challenge, as machines lack active experience with the physical world. Given this scenario, semantic knowledge graphs can serve as conceptual spaces that guide the automated text generation reasoning process to achieve more efficient and explainable results. In this paper, we apply a logic-augmented generation (LAG) framework that leverages the explicit representation of a text through a semantic knowledge graph and applies it in combination with prompt heuristics to elicit implicit analogical connections. This method generates extended knowledge graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three metaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they require deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this integrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in understanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning processes, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding, especially for domain-specific metaphors. Furthermore, we propose a thorough error analysis, discussing issues with metaphorical annotations and current evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in specialized domains like ophthalmology remains underexplored. This study comprehensively evaluated and compared the accuracy and reasoning capabilities of four newly developed reasoning-focused LLMs, namely DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking. Each model was assessed using 5,888 multiple-choice ophthalmology exam questions from the MedMCQA dataset in zero-shot setting. Quantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed against ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a subset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified ophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning structure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and DeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in Macro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>83 pa...</summary><p>83 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, 9 supplementary figures, 7 supplementary tables</p></details> |
| **[MMC: Iterative Refinement of VLM Reasoning via MCTS-based Multimodal Critique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11009v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks but still face challenges such as hallucinations, resulting in incorrect reasoning outcomes. Inspired by recent research on external feedback mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), we propose a multimodal actor-critic framework to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities. Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning paths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these reasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively refines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is deemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual annotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal critique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we systematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To obtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an annotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared ancestor node - one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an incorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based Multimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive training and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments conducted on several public benchmark datasets and mainstream VLMs demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of VLM on complex multimodal reasoning tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and wide applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, the medical knowledge required for input is a huge obstacle for general public, which greatly reduces the universality of these methods. Compared with these domain-specialized auxiliary information, general users tend to rely on oral queries that require logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel medical vision task: Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MedSD), which aims to comprehend implicit queries about medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation mask and bounding box for the target object. To accomplish this task, we first introduce a Multi-perspective, Logic-driven Medical Reasoning Segmentation and Detection (MLMR-SD) dataset, which encompasses a substantial collection of medical entity targets along with their corresponding reasoning. Furthermore, we propose MediSee, an effective baseline model designed for medical reasoning segmentation and detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address MedSD with implicit colloquial queries and outperform traditional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, the emergence of this "slow-thinking" paradigm, with numerous tokens generated in sequence, inevitably introduces substantial computational overhead. To this end, it highlights an urgent need for effective acceleration. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in efficient reasoning. It categorizes existing works into three key directions: (1) shorter - compressing lengthy CoTs into concise yet effective reasoning chains; (2) smaller - developing compact language models with strong reasoning capabilities through techniques such as knowledge distillation, other model compression techniques, and reinforcement learning; and (3) faster - designing efficient decoding strategies to accelerate inference. A curated collection of papers discussed in this survey is available in our GitHub repository.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in open--ended, knowledge--intensive, complex reasoning scenarios is still limited. Reasoning--oriented methods struggle to generalize to open--ended scenarios due to implicit assumptions of complete world knowledge. Meanwhile, knowledge--augmented reasoning (KAR) methods fail to address two core challenges: 1) error propagation, where errors in early steps cascade through the chain, and 2) verification bottleneck, where the explore--exploit tradeoff arises in multi--branch decision processes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARise, a novel framework that integrates risk assessment of intermediate reasoning states with dynamic retrieval--augmented generation (RAG) within a Monte Carlo tree search paradigm. This approach enables effective construction and optimization of reasoning plans across multiple maintained hypothesis branches. Experimental results show that ARise significantly outperforms the state--of--the--art KAR methods by up to 23.10%, and the latest RAG-equipped large reasoning models by up to 25.37%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project homepage: https://opencausalab.github.io/ARise</p></details> |

However, the substantial computational overhead associated with LVLMs presents a new challenge. The primary source of this computational cost arises from processing hundreds of image tokens. Therefore, an effective strategy to mitigate such overhead is to reduce the number of image tokens, a process known as image token pruning. Previous studies on image token pruning for LVLMs have primarily focused on high level visual understanding tasks, such as visual question answering and image captioning. In contrast, guiding vision foundation models to generate accurate visual masks based on textual queries demands precise semantic and spatial reasoning capabilities. Consequently, pruning methods must carefully control individual image tokens throughout the LVLM reasoning process. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods struggle to adequately balance reductions in computational overhead with the necessity to maintain high segmentation accuracy. In this work, we propose LVLM_CSP, a novel training free visual token pruning method specifically designed for LVLM based reasoning segmentation tasks. LVLM_CSP consists of three stages: clustering, scattering, and pruning. Initially, the LVLM performs coarse-grained visual reasoning using a subset of selected image tokens. Next, fine grained reasoning is conducted, and finally, most visual tokens are pruned in the last stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVLM_CSP achieves a 65% reduction in image token inference FLOPs with virtually no accuracy degradation, and a 70% reduction with only a minor 1% drop in accuracy on the 7B LVLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LayoutCoT: Unleashing the Deep Reasoning Potential of Large Language Models for Layout Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10829v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
