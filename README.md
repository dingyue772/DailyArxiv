| **[The Geometry of Truth: Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04933v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables.

| **[When Models Lie, We Learn: Multilingual Span-Level Hallucination Detection with PsiloQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04849v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained, multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work, we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models -- and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets. Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained hallucination detection in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAG:Tangential Amplifying Guidance for Hallucination-Resistant Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04533v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[SECA: Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks for Eliciting LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04398v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

| **[Measuring Language Model Hallucinations Through Distributional Correctness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04302v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common evaluation paradigms for language models focus on scoring single responses through accuracy metrics or proper scoring rules, failing to capture the full richness of a model's belief state. Recent work illustrates that language models hallucinate in-part because they are optimised to be good test-takers under binary scoring schemes that reward any answer over abstention. While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches, they ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for example between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward "I don't know" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness Score (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a model's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally distinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty expressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default range. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, DCS is demonstrated to offer a more nuanced and aligned evaluation paradigm that incentivises models to express genuine uncertainty rather than guessing. Adapting 12 existing evaluation benchmarks to DCS's variants and measuring performance on six language models reveals that for half of the tested benchmarks scores are negative across all tested models, indicating significant tendencies towards hallucination.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MaskCD: Mitigating LVLM Hallucinations by Image Head Masked Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02790v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to emnlp2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Reason for Hallucination Span Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02173v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluGuard: Evidence-Grounded Small Reasoning Models to Mitigate Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00880v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and (iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy (BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copy-Paste to Mitigate Large Language Model Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00508v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context, leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM, obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation.

| **[Beyond Token Probes: Hallucination Detection via Activation Tensors with ACT-ViT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00296v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning. Full code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/ACT-ViT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points for Navigation in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26513v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroundSight: Augmenting Vision-Language Models with Grounding Information and De-hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25669v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79% to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceDet: Hallucination Detection from the Decoding Trace of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01274v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations. To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Message-Passing on Attention Graphs for Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24770v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content, known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 25 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Visual Hallucinations via Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24491v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE25 |
| **[LLM Hallucination Detection: HSAD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23580v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.</p></details> | Preprint |

| **[Tail-Safe Hedging: Explainable Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with a White-Box CBF--QP Safety Layer in Arbitrage-Free Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04555v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Tail-Safe, a deployability-oriented framework for derivatives hedging that unifies distributional, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with a white-box control-barrier-function (CBF) quadratic-program (QP) safety layer tailored to financial constraints. The learning component combines an IQN-based distributional critic with a CVaR objective (IQN--CVaR--PPO) and a Tail-Coverage Controller that regulates quantile sampling through temperature tilting and tail boosting to stabilize small-$\alpha$ estimation. The safety component enforces discrete-time CBF inequalities together with domain-specific constraints -- ellipsoidal no-trade bands, box and rate limits, and a sign-consistency gate -- solved as a convex QP whose telemetry (active sets, tightness, rate utilization, gate scores, slack, and solver status) forms an auditable trail for governance. We provide guarantees of robust forward invariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation projection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state KL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity results for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region improvement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence under expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free, microstructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\to$ Dupire $\to$ VIX with ABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading central performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP is feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and incident workflows to support explainability and auditability. Limitations include reliance on synthetic data and simplified execution to isolate methodological contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages including appendices; 5 figures.

| **[Read the Scene, Not the Script: Outcome-Aware Safety for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04320v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and reproducible evaluation path.</p></details> |  |
| **[COSMO-RL: Towards Trustworthy LMRMs via Joint Safety and Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04196v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) are moving into real applications, where they must be both useful and safe. Safety is especially challenging in multimodal settings: images and text can be combined to bypass guardrails, and single objective training can cause policy drift that yields over-refusal on benign inputs or unsafe compliance on risky ones. We present COSMO-RL, a mixed reinforcement learning framework that trains reasoning oriented LMRMs under multimodal, multitask, and multiobjective signals, and we release the resulting model, COSMO-R1. Our approach aims to let safety and capability grow together in one stable pipeline rather than competing during alignment. In experiments, COSMO-R1 improves safety while maintaining-and often improving multimodal reasoning and instruction following, shows stronger robustness to multimodal jailbreaks, and reduces unnecessary refusals. The framework also transfers across backbones with consistent gains. Ablations support the design choices, indicating a simple path to advancing safety and general capability together in LMRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating construction safety inspections using a multi-modal vision-language RAG framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04145v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in generating safety reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[MonitorVLM:A Vision Language Framework for Safety Violation Detection in Mining Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03666v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors. Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Oriented Dynamic Path Planning for Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03640v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in autonomous vehicles necessitates advanced path planning and obstacle avoidance capabilities, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a bi-level control framework that efficiently augments road boundaries by incorporating time-dependent grid projections of obstacle movements, thus enabling precise and adaptive path planning. The main control loop utilizes Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for real-time path optimization, wherein homotopy-based constraint relaxation is employed to improve the solvability of the optimal control problem (OCP). Furthermore, an independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our approach. Overall, the framework represents a significant step towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving in complex and dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE 101st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2025-Spring), Oslo, Norway, June 17-20, 2025.

| **[TITE-Safety: Time-to-event Safety Monitoring for Clinical Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03175v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety evaluation is an essential component of clinical trials. To protect study participants, these studies often implement safety stopping rules that will halt the trial if an excessive number of toxicity events occur. Existing safety monitoring methods often treat these events as binary outcomes. A strategy that instead handles these as time-to-event endpoints can offer higher power and a reduced time to signal of excess risk, but must manage additional complexities including censoring and competing risks. We propose the TITE-Safety approach for safety monitoring, which incorporates time-to-event information while handling censored observations and competing risks appropriately. This strategy is applied to develop stopping rules using score tests, Bayesian beta-extended binomial models, and sequential probability ratio tests. The operating characteristics of these methods are studied via simulation for common phase 2 and 3 trial scenarios. Across simulation settings, the proposed techniques offer reductions in expected toxicities of 20% or more compared to binary data methods and maintain the type I error rate near the nominal level across various event time distributions. These methods are demonstrated through a redesign of the safety monitoring scheme for BMT CTN 0601, a single arm, phase 2 trial that evaluated bone marrow transplant as treatment for severe sickle cell disease. Our R package "stoppingrule" offers functions to construct and evaluate these stopping rules, providing valuable tools for trial design to investigators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Point Cloud-Based Control Barrier Functions for Model Predictive Control in Safety-Critical Navigation of Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02885v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the robotics community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, accepted to IROS2025</p></details> |
| **[A Granular Study of Safety Pretraining under Model Abliteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02768v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated, we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments.

| **[UpSafe$^\circ$C: Upcycling for Controllable Safety in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02194v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment -- each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model, and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Control Barrier Functions: A Path Towards Nonparametric Safety Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02127v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of complex dynamical systems often relies on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Both methods require computing a function that characterizes a safe set that can be made (control) invariant. However, the computational burden of solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (for HJ Reachability) or large-scale semidefinite programs (for CBFs) makes finding such functions challenging. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Recurrent Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs), a novel class of CBFs that leverages a recurrent property of the trajectories, i.e., coming back to a safe set, for safety verification. Under mild assumptions, we show that the RCBF condition holds for the signed-distance function, turning function design into set identification. Notably, the resulting set need not be invariant to certify safety. We further propose a data-driven nonparametric method to compute safe sets that is massively parallelizable and trades off conservativeness against computational cost.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |
| **[AdvEvo-MARL: Shaping Internalized Safety through Adversarial Co-Evolution in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01586v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvThink: Towards AI Safety via Inverse Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01569v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable Design Approach to Resilient Architectures for Interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems: Safety Guarantees under Multiple Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01541v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex, interconnected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly prevalent in domains such as power systems. Cyber-resilient architectures have been proposed to recover compromised cyber components of CPS. Recent works have studied tuning the recovery times of such architectures to guarantee safety in single-system settings. Extending these designs to interconnected CPS is more challenging, since solutions must account for attacks on multiple subsystems that can occur in any order and potentially infinite possible temporal overlap. This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenge by developing a scalable framework to assign resilient architectures and to inform the tuning of their recovery times. Our approach introduces a scalar index that quantifies the impact of each subsystem on safety under compromised input. These indices aggregate linearly across subsystems, enabling scalable analysis under arbitrary attack orderings and temporal overlaps. We establish a linear inequality relating each subsystem's index and recovery time that guarantees safety and guides resilient architecture assignment. We also propose a segmentation-based approach to strengthen the previously derived conditions. We then present algorithms to compute the proposed indices and to find a cost-optimal architecture assignment with a safety guarantee. We validate the framework through a case study on temperature regulation in interconnected rooms under different attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Modeling and Explainable AI for Veterinary Safety Profiles, Residue Assessment, and Health Outcomes Using Real-World Data and Physicochemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01520v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed, and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best, achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost. Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors, including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate, interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles, strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Control Barrier Functions: Safety in Probability for Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01501v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities, the scenario approach, and conformal prediction, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Control via Recurrent Tracking Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01147v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs), which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control $\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs' effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.</p></details> | 7 Pages, 2 Figures |
| **[Safety Instincts: LLMs Learn to Trust Their Internal Compass for Self-Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01088v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManagerBench: Evaluating the Safety-Pragmatism Trade-off in Autonomous LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00857v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical. Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification, tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems to enhance VRU safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
