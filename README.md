Dynamics, curricula and hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21676v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models accumulate vast knowledge during pre-training, yet the dynamics governing this acquisition remain poorly understood. This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, exhibiting a performance plateau before acquiring precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, as imbalanced distributions lead to shorter plateaus. Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training.</p></details> |  |

Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses. Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Alleviating LLM-based Generative Retrieval Hallucination in Alipay Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21098v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Mitigating Low-Level Visual Hallucinations Requires Self-Awareness: Database, Model and Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20673v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework. However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy for Hallucination Detection in Medical Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20504v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). Yet, they remain prone to hallucinations-incorrect responses that contradict input images, posing substantial risks in clinical decision-making. Detecting these hallucinations is essential for establishing trust in MLLMs among clinicians and patients, thereby enabling their real-world adoption. Current hallucination detection methods, especially semantic entropy (SE), have demonstrated promising hallucination detection capacity for LLMs. However, adapting SE to medical MLLMs by incorporating visual perturbations presents a dilemma. Weak perturbations preserve image content and ensure clinical validity, but may be overlooked by medical MLLMs, which tend to over rely on language priors. In contrast, strong perturbations can distort essential diagnostic features, compromising clinical interpretation. To address this issue, we propose Vision Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE), which incorporates weak image transformations and amplifies the impact of visual input, to improve hallucination detection in medical VQA. We first estimate the semantic predictive distribution under weak visual transformations to preserve clinical validity, and then amplify visual influence by contrasting this distribution with that derived from a distorted image. The entropy of the resulting distribution is estimated as VASE. Experiments on two medical open-ended VQA datasets demonstrate that VASE consistently outperforms existing hallucination detection methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

While addressing hallucinations becomes a substantial challenge for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark dataset called OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from the TBox (i.e. schema-matching) datasets in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are carefully classified into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset in constructing the LLM leaderboard and fine-tuning foundational LLMs for LLM-based OM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, 2 prompt templates</p></details> |
| **[Guarding against artificial intelligence--hallucinated citations: the case for full-text reference deposit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19848v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tendency of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems to "hallucinate" false information is well-known; AI-generated citations to non-existent sources have made their way into the reference lists of peer-reviewed publications. Here, I propose a solution to this problem, taking inspiration from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) data sharing guidelines, the clash of generative AI with the American judiciary, and the precedent set by submissions of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Journals should require authors to submit the full text of each cited source along with their manuscripts, thereby preventing authors from citing any material whose full text they cannot produce. This solution requires limited additional work on the part of authors or editors while effectively immunizing journals against hallucinated references.</p></details> | 3 pages |
| **[HausaNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Towards a Fine-Grained Model-Aware Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19650v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents our findings of the Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, MU-SHROOM, which focuses on identifying hallucinations and related overgeneration errors in large language models (LLMs). The shared task involves detecting specific text spans that constitute hallucinations in the outputs generated by LLMs in 14 languages. To address this task, we aim to provide a nuanced, model-aware understanding of hallucination occurrences and severity in English. We used natural language inference and fine-tuned a ModernBERT model using a synthetic dataset of 400 samples, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.032 and a correlation score of 0.422. These results indicate a moderately positive correlation between the model's confidence scores and the actual presence of hallucinations. The IoU score indicates that our model has a relatively low overlap between the predicted hallucination span and the truth annotation. The performance is unsurprising, given the intricate nature of hallucination detection. Hallucinations often manifest subtly, relying on context, making pinpointing their exact boundaries formidable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Hallucination of Large Multimodal Models in Video Understanding: Benchmark, Analysis and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19622v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hallucination of large multimodal models (LMMs), providing responses that appear correct but are actually incorrect, limits their reliability and applicability. This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%. The code and data are public at https://github.com/Hongcheng-Gao/HAVEN.</p></details> |  |
| **[KSHSeek: Data-Driven Approaches to Mitigating and Detecting Knowledge-Shortcut Hallucinations in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19482v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the development of natural language processing (NLP), especially in text generation tasks like question answering. However, model hallucinations remain a major challenge in natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their complex causes. We systematically expand on the causes of factual hallucinations from the perspective of knowledge shortcuts, analyzing hallucinations arising from correct and defect-free data and demonstrating that knowledge-shortcut hallucinations are prevalent in generative models. To mitigate this issue, we propose a high similarity pruning algorithm at the data preprocessing level to reduce spurious correlations in the data. Additionally, we design a specific detection method for knowledge-shortcut hallucinations to evaluate the effectiveness of our mitigation strategy. Experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces knowledge-shortcut hallucinations, particularly in fine-tuning tasks, without negatively impacting model performance in question answering. This work introduces a new paradigm for mitigating specific hallucination issues in generative models, enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18556v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success of Large Vision-Language models(LVLMs), these models still suffer hallucinations when describing images, generating answers that include non-existent objects. It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations. Our IAVA approach is available online at https://github.com/Lee-lab558/IAVA.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[ShED-HD: A Shannon Entropy Distribution Framework for Lightweight Hallucination Detection on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18242v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[FactSelfCheck: Fact-Level Black-Box Hallucination Detection for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17229v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only an 8% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Don't Fight Hallucinations, Use Them: Estimating Image Realism using NLI over Atomic Facts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15948v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the realism of images remains a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of De-Factify 4: 4nd Workshop on Multimodal Fact Checking and Hate Speech Detection, co-located with AAAI-2025</p></details> |

We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations in MLLMs via Multi-Frequency Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14895v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual-language tasks. However, the authenticity of the responses generated by MLLMs is often compromised by object hallucinations. We identify that a key cause of these hallucinations is the model's over-susceptibility to specific image frequency features in detecting objects. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Frequency Perturbations (MFP), a simple, cost-effective, and pluggable method that leverages both low-frequency and high-frequency features of images to perturb visual feature representations and explicitly suppress redundant frequency-domain features during inference, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates object hallucinations across various model architectures. Furthermore, as a training-time method, MFP can be combined with inference-time methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poly-FEVER: A Multilingual Fact Verification Benchmark for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16541v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), pose a significant challenge to the reliability of multilingual applications. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection focus primarily on English and a few widely spoken languages, lacking the breadth to assess inconsistencies in model performance across diverse linguistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce Poly-FEVER, a large-scale multilingual fact verification benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs. Poly-FEVER comprises 77,973 labeled factual claims spanning 11 languages, sourced from FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact. It provides the first large-scale dataset tailored for analyzing hallucination patterns across languages, enabling systematic evaluation of LLMs such as ChatGPT and the LLaMA series. Our analysis reveals how topic distribution and web resource availability influence hallucination frequency, uncovering language-specific biases that impact model accuracy. By offering a multilingual benchmark for fact verification, Poly-FEVER facilitates cross-linguistic comparisons of hallucination detection and contributes to the development of more reliable, language-inclusive AI systems. The dataset is publicly available to advance research in responsible AI, fact-checking methodologies, and multilingual NLP, promoting greater transparency and robustness in LLM performance. The proposed Poly-FEVER is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HanzhiZhang/Poly-FEVER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Verbal Uncertainty as a Linear Feature to Reduce Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14477v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs often adopt an assertive language style also when making false claims. Such ``overconfident hallucinations'' mislead users and erode trust. Achieving the ability to express in language the actual degree of uncertainty around a claim is therefore of great importance. We find that ``verbal uncertainty'' is governed by a single linear feature in the representation space of LLMs, and show that this has only moderate correlation with the actual ``semantic uncertainty'' of the model. We apply this insight and show that (1) the mismatch between semantic and verbal uncertainty is a better predictor of hallucinations than semantic uncertainty alone and (2) we can intervene on verbal uncertainty at inference time and reduce hallucinations on short-form answers, achieving an average relative reduction of 32%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From "Hallucination" to "Suture": Insights from Language Philosophy to Enhance Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14392v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores hallucination phenomena in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of language philosophy and psychoanalysis. By incorporating Lacan's concepts of the "chain of signifiers" and "suture points," we propose the Anchor-RAG framework as a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations. In contrast to the predominant reliance on trial-and-error experiments, constant adjustments of mathematical formulas, or resource-intensive methods that emphasize quantity over quality, our approach returns to the fundamental principles of linguistics to analyze the root causes of hallucinations in LLMs. Drawing from robust theoretical foundations, we derive algorithms and models that are not only effective in reducing hallucinations but also enhance LLM performance and improve output quality. This paper seeks to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding hallucinations in LLMs and aims to challenge the prevalent "guess-and-test" approach and rat race mentality in the field. We aspire to pave the way for a new era of interpretable LLMs, offering deeper insights into the inner workings of language-based AI systems.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, when applied to hardware description languages (HDL), these models exhibit significant limitations due to data scarcity, resulting in hallucinations and incorrect code generation. To address these challenges, we propose HDLCoRe, a training-free framework that enhances LLMs' HDL generation capabilities through prompt engineering techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our approach consists of two main components: (1) an HDL-aware Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique with self-verification that classifies tasks by complexity and type, incorporates domain-specific knowledge, and guides LLMs through step-by-step self-simulation for error correction; and (2) a two-stage heterogeneous RAG system that addresses formatting inconsistencies through key component extraction and efficiently retrieves relevant HDL examples through sequential filtering and re-ranking. HDLCoRe eliminates the need for model fine-tuning while substantially improving LLMs' HDL generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance on the RTLLM2.0 benchmark, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving both syntactic and functional correctness.</p></details> |  |

| **[Language Model Uncertainty Quantification with Attention Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19168v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately quantifying a large language model's (LLM) predictive uncertainty is crucial for judging the reliability of its answers. While most existing research focuses on short, directly answerable questions with closed-form outputs (e.g., multiple-choice), involving intermediate reasoning steps in LLM responses is increasingly important. This added complexity complicates uncertainty quantification (UQ) because the probabilities assigned to answer tokens are conditioned on a vast space of preceding reasoning tokens. Direct marginalization is infeasible, and the dependency inflates probability estimates, causing overconfidence in UQ. To address this, we propose UQAC, an efficient method that narrows the reasoning space to a tractable size for marginalization. UQAC iteratively constructs an "attention chain" of tokens deemed "semantically crucial" to the final answer via a backtracking procedure. Starting from the answer tokens, it uses attention weights to identify the most influential predecessors, then iterates this process until reaching the input tokens. Similarity filtering and probability thresholding further refine the resulting chain, allowing us to approximate the marginal probabilities of the answer tokens, which serve as the LLM's confidence. We validate UQAC on multiple reasoning benchmarks with advanced open-source LLMs, demonstrating that it consistently delivers reliable UQ estimates with high computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, 30 tables</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Human-Aligned Large Language Model Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12528v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has sought to quantify large language model uncertainty to facilitate model control and modulate user trust. Previous works focus on measures of uncertainty that are theoretically grounded or reflect the average overt behavior of the model. In this work, we investigate a variety of uncertainty measures, in order to identify measures that correlate with human group-level uncertainty. We find that Bayesian measures and a variation on entropy measures, top-k entropy, tend to agree with human behavior as a function of model size. We find that some strong measures decrease in human-similarity with model size, but, by multiple linear regression, we find that combining multiple uncertainty measures provide comparable human-alignment with reduced size-dependency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accounting for Sycophancy in Language Model Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14746v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective human-machine collaboration requires machine learning models to externalize uncertainty, so users can reflect and intervene when necessary. For language models, these representations of uncertainty may be impacted by sycophancy bias: proclivity to agree with users, even if they are wrong. For instance, models may be over-confident in (incorrect) problem solutions suggested by a user. We study the relationship between sycophancy and uncertainty estimation for the first time. We propose a generalization of the definition of sycophancy bias to measure downstream impacts on uncertainty estimation, and also propose a new algorithm (SyRoUP) to account for sycophancy in the uncertainty estimation process. Unlike previous works on sycophancy, we study a broad array of user behaviors, varying both correctness and confidence of user suggestions to see how model answers (and their certainty) change. Our experiments across conversation forecasting and question-answering tasks show that user confidence plays a critical role in modulating the effects of sycophancy, and that SyRoUP can better predict these effects. From these results, we argue that externalizing both model and user uncertainty can help to mitigate the impacts of sycophancy bias.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate uncertainty metrics, focusing on Answer, Correctness, Aleatoric, and Epistemic Uncertainty. Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

| **["I'm Not Sure, But...": Examining the Impact of Large Language Models' Uncertainty Expression on User Reliance and Trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00623v2)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FAccT 2024.

| **[Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model: A Natural Generalization of Bradley-Terry Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22480v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model. PURM learns reward distributions directly from preference data and quantifies per-sample uncertainty via the average overlap area between reward distributions. To mitigate reward hacking, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process Reward Modeling with Entropy-Driven Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22233v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Entropy-Driven Unified Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel framework that approximates state-of-the-art performance in process supervision while drastically reducing training costs. EDU-PRM introduces an entropy-guided dynamic step partitioning mechanism, using logit distribution entropy to pinpoint high-uncertainty regions during token generation dynamically. This self-assessment capability enables precise step-level feedback without manual fine-grained annotation, addressing a critical challenge in process supervision. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-72B model with only 7,500 EDU-PRM-generated training queries demonstrate accuracy closely approximating the full Qwen2.5-72B-PRM (71.1% vs. 71.6%), achieving a 98% reduction in query cost compared to prior methods. This work establishes EDU-PRM as an efficient approach for scalable process reward model training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Data Scaling Trends and Effects in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22230v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel system deployed at Alibaba that leverages AI-generated items (AIGI) to address these challenges with personalized text-to-image generation for e-commercial product design. AIGI enables an innovative business mode called "sell it before you make it", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions. Only when the items have received a certain number of orders, do the merchants start to produce them, which largely reduces reliance on physical prototypes and thus accelerates time to market. For such a promising application, we identify the underlying key scientific challenge, i.e., capturing the users' group-level personalized preferences towards multiple generated candidate images. To this end, we propose a Personalized Group-Level Preference Alignment Framework for Diffusion Models (i.e., PerFusion). We first design PerFusion Reward Model for user preference estimation with a feature-crossing-based personalized plug-in. Then we develop PerFusion with a personalized adaptive network to model diverse preferences across users, and meanwhile derive the group-level preference optimization objective to capture the comparative behaviors among multiple candidates. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The AI-generated items have achieved over 13% relative improvements for both click-through rate and conversion rate compared to their human-designed counterparts, validating the revolutionary potential of AI-generated items for e-commercial platforms.</p></details> | Under Review |

Coverage, Scaling, and Optimality in Inference-Time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21878v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time computation provides an important axis for scaling language model performance, but naively scaling compute through techniques like Best-of-$N$ sampling can cause performance to degrade due to reward hacking. Toward a theoretical understanding of how to best leverage additional computation, we focus on inference-time alignment which we formalize as the problem of improving a pre-trained policy's responses for a prompt of interest, given access to an imperfect reward model. We analyze the performance of inference-time alignment algorithms in terms of (i) response quality, and (ii) compute, and provide new results that highlight the importance of the pre-trained policy's coverage over high-quality responses for performance and compute scaling: 1. We show that Best-of-$N$ alignment with an ideal choice for $N$ can achieve optimal performance under stringent notions of coverage, but provably suffers from reward hacking when $N$ is large, and fails to achieve tight guarantees under more realistic coverage conditions. 2. We introduce $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$, a new algorithm which mitigates reward hacking through deliberate use of inference-time compute, implementing the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via rejection sampling; we prove that its performance is optimal and does not degrade with $N$, meaning it is scaling-monotonic. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental evaluation that demonstrate the benefits of $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$ across a variety of tasks and models.</p></details> |  |

Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising solution by evaluating each reasoning step. However, existing PRMs typically output evaluation scores directly, limiting both learning efficiency and evaluation accuracy, which is further exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated data. To address these issues, we propose Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling (R-PRM). First, we leverage stronger LLMs to generate seed data from limited annotations, effectively bootstrapping our model's reasoning capabilities and enabling comprehensive step-by-step evaluation. Second, we further enhance performance through preference optimization, without requiring additional annotated data. Third, we introduce inference-time scaling to fully harness the model's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate R-PRM's effectiveness: on ProcessBench and PRMBench, it surpasses strong baselines by 11.9 and 8.5 points in F1 scores, respectively. When applied to guide mathematical reasoning, R-PRM achieves consistent accuracy improvements of over 8.5 points across six challenging datasets. Further analysis reveals that R-PRM exhibits more comprehensive evaluation and stronger generalization capabilities, thereby highlighting its significant potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/R-PRM</p></details> |
| **[Multi-head Reward Aggregation Guided by Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20995v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with safety guidelines typically involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), relying on human-generated preference annotations. However, assigning consistent overall quality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards detailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper uncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating entropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by humans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward entropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules exhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that rules with elevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry optimization framework, justifying our entropy-based penalization. Through extensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, our method significantly surpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods. Our proposed approach is training-free, broadly applicable to various datasets, and maintains interpretability, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-attribute reward modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLBench: A Suite for Vision-Language Process Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20271v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-supervised reward models serve as a fine-grained function that provides detailed step-wise feedback to model responses, facilitating effective selection of reasoning trajectories for complex tasks. Despite its advantages, evaluation on PRMs remains less explored, especially in the multimodal domain. To address this gap, this paper first benchmarks current vision large language models (VLLMs) as two types of reward models: output reward models (ORMs) and process reward models (PRMs) on multiple vision-language benchmarks, which reveal that neither ORM nor PRM consistently outperforms across all tasks, and superior VLLMs do not necessarily yield better rewarding performance. To further advance evaluation, we introduce ViLBench, a vision-language benchmark designed to require intensive process reward signals. Notably, OpenAI's GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) achieves only 27.3% accuracy, indicating the benchmark's challenge for current VLLMs. Lastly, we preliminarily showcase a promising pathway towards bridging the gap between general VLLMs and reward models -- by collecting 73.6K vision-language process reward data using an enhanced tree-search algorithm, our 3B model is able to achieve an average improvement of 3.3% over standard CoT and up to 2.5% compared to its untrained counterpart on ViLBench by selecting OpenAI o1's generations. We release the implementations at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/ViLBench with our code, model, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Safe and Aligned Language Generation: A Multi-Objective GRPO Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21819v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and safety constraints is challenging, especially when objectives like helpfulness, truthfulness, and avoidance of harm conflict. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved notable success in steering models, but is complex and can be unstable. Recent approaches such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplify preference-based fine-tuning but may introduce bias or trade-off certain objectives~\cite{dpo}. In this work, we propose a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework with a multi-label reward regression model to achieve safe and aligned language generation. The GRPO algorithm optimizes a policy by comparing groups of sampled responses, eliminating the need for a separate value critic and improving training efficiency~\cite{grpo}. We train a reward model to predict multiple alignment scores (e.g., safety, helpfulness, etc.), which are combined into a single reward signal. We provide a theoretical derivation for using this learned multi-aspect reward within GRPO and discuss its advantages and limitations. Empirically, our approach improves all the safety and quality metrics evaluated in language generation tasks on model scales (0.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters), demonstrating a robust balance of objectives. We compare GRPO to PPO-based RLHF and DPO, highlighting that GRPO achieves alignment with significantly lower computational cost and explicit multi-objective handling. \textbf{We will open-source all trained models at https://huggingface.co/hydroxai.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAPO: Learning Preferential Prompt through Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20194v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints. While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO. Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs. Code is avaliable in https://github.com/MikeGu721/GAPO.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) excel in many reasoning tasks, their ability to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for text-to-SQL remains underexplored. We identify critical limitations: zero-shot CoT offers minimal gains, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied without CoT yields marginal improvements. We propose ExCoT, a novel framework that iteratively optimizes open-source LLMs by combining CoT reasoning with off-policy and on-policy DPO, relying solely on execution accuracy as feedback. This approach eliminates the need for reward models or human-annotated preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains: ExCoT improves execution accuracy on BIRD dev set from 57.37% to 68.51% and on Spider test set from 78.81% to 86.59% for LLaMA-3 70B, with Qwen-2.5-Coder demonstrating similar improvements. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single-model setting on both BIRD and Spider datasets, notably achieving 68.53% on the BIRD test set.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, in this study we introduce a novel framework, Indirect Prompt Gradient Optimization (IPGO), for prompt-level fine-tuning. IPGO enhances prompt embeddings by injecting continuously differentiable tokens at the beginning and end of the prompt embeddings, while exploiting low-rank benefits and flexibility from rotations. It allows for gradient-based optimization of injected tokens while enforcing value, orthonormality, and conformity constraints, facilitating continuous updates and empowering computational efficiency. To evaluate the performance of IPGO, we conduct prompt-wise and prompt-batch training with three reward models targeting image aesthetics, image-text alignment, and human preferences under three datasets of different complexity. The results show that IPGO consistently matches or outperforms cutting-edge benchmarks, including stable diffusion v1.5 with raw prompts, training-based approaches (DRaFT and DDPO), and training-free methods (DPO-Diffusion, Promptist, and ChatGPT-4o). Furthermore, we demonstrate IPGO's effectiveness in enhancing image generation quality while requiring minimal training data and limited computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well. We are releasing these 1.4 million problems and their corresponding responses to the research community with the objective of fostering the development of powerful reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs).

| **[A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19201v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we frame game balancing as a procedural content generation task and propose an architecture for automatically balancing of tile-based levels within the PCGRL framework (procedural content generation via reinforcement learning). Our architecture is divided into three parts: (1) a level generator, (2) a balancing agent, and (3) a reward modeling simulation. Through repeated simulations, the balancing agent receives rewards for adjusting the level towards a given balancing objective, such as equal win rates for all players. To this end, we propose new swap-based representations to improve the robustness of playability, thereby enabling agents to balance game levels more effectively and quickly compared to traditional PCGRL. By analyzing the agent's swapping behavior, we can infer which tile types have the most impact on the balance. We validate our approach in the Neural MMO (NMMO) environment in a competitive two-player scenario. In this extended conference paper, we present improved results, explore the applicability of the method to various forms of balancing beyond equal balancing, compare the performance to another search-based approach, and discuss the application of existing fairness metrics to game balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the journal (IEEE Transactions on Games) paper of the same name</p></details> |

However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-wise Multi-dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling. The code is available at https://github.com/Galery23/Similar-v1.</p></details> |  |

However, current alignment methods face three main limitations: (1) reliance on costly human annotation; (2) alignment tax; (3) shallow alignment vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Additionally, current alignment datasets often suffer from uneven distributions, leading to overrepresentation of some topics and neglect of others. To address these issues, we propose SRMIR (Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning), inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. We first construct a balanced safety Chain of Draft (CoD) dataset across $7$ harmful types with structured prompt leveraging the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs, then train a set of specialized reward models to guide policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We apply two strategies, linear combination and categorized approach, to integrate shadow reward models for policy optimization. By comparison, we find that the latter achieves superior alignment despite higher computational costs. Experiments across several LLMs demonstrate SRMIR significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, preference optimization, derived from the language domain, has emerged as an effective post-training reinforcement strategy to enhance capabilities of LVLMs. However, constructing high-quality human-annotated preference data and developing robust reward models to mimic these preferences are both costly and challenging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Vision-R1, a novel vision-guided R1-like reinforcement learning algorithm for LVLMs that rewards models with definitive vision feedback. It only leverages curated instruction data, eliminating the need for specialized reward models and handcrafted preference datasets. We incorporate a criterion-driven reward function that further integrates multi-dimensional feedback to evaluate model completions comprehensively based on the vision task logic. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive rule refinement strategy that dynamically adjusts the reward criteria during training, enabling continuous model improvement and mitigating reward hacking. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the 7B LVLMs with Vision-R1 achieves consistent performance gains, with even up to 50% improvement and surpassing the state-of-the-art 10x size model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project in development.

In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  |
