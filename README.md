| **[Omni-iEEG: A Large-Scale, Comprehensive iEEG Dataset and Benchmark for Epilepsy Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16072v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

| **[OMNI-LEAK: Orchestrator Multi-Agent Network Induced Data Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13477v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepi...</summary><p>Prepint, under review for ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[DreamID-Omni: Unified Framework for Controllable Human-Centric Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12160v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://guoxu1233.github.io/DreamID-Omni/</p></details> |
| **[Tele-Omni: a Unified Multimodal Framework for Video Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09609v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Safety under Cross-Modality Conflict: Vulnerabilities, Dynamics Mechanisms and Efficient Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10161v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) greatly expand LLMs' multimodal capabilities but also introduce cross-modal safety risks. However, a systematic understanding of vulnerabilities in omni-modal interactions remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we establish a modality-semantics decoupling principle and construct the AdvBench-Omni dataset, which reveals a significant vulnerability in OLLMs. Mechanistic analysis uncovers a Mid-layer Dissolution phenomenon driven by refusal vector magnitude shrinkage, alongside the existence of a modal-invariant pure refusal direction. Inspired by these insights, we extract a golden refusal vector using Singular Value Decomposition and propose OmniSteer, which utilizes lightweight adapters to modulate intervention intensity adaptively. Extensive experiments show that our method not only increases the Refusal Success Rate against harmful inputs from 69.9% to 91.2%, but also effectively preserves the general capabilities across all modalities. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/omni-safety-research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Video 2: Scaling MLLM-Conditioned Diffusion for Unified Video Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08820v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Omni-Video 2, a scalable and computationally efficient model that connects pretrained multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) with video diffusion models for unified video generation and editing. Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation. The results demonstrate its superior ability to follow complex compositional instructions in video editing, while also achieving competitive or superior quality in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/Omni-Video2-project/</p></details> |
| **[Ex-Omni: Enabling 3D Facial Animation Generation for Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07106v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Physical Intelligence Emergence via Omni-Modal Architecture and Physical Data Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07064v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical understanding remains brittle in omni-modal models because key physical attributes are visually ambiguous and sparsely represented in web-scale data. We present OmniFysics, a compact omni-modal model that unifies understanding across images, audio, video, and text, with integrated speech and image generation. To inject explicit physical knowledge, we build a physical data engine with two components. FysicsAny produces physics-grounded instruction--image supervision by mapping salient objects to verified physical attributes through hierarchical retrieval over a curated prototype database, followed by physics-law--constrained verification and caption rewriting. FysicsOmniCap distills web videos via audio--visual consistency filtering to generate high-fidelity video--instruction pairs emphasizing cross-modal physical cues. We train OmniFysics with staged multimodal alignment and instruction tuning, adopt latent-space flow matching for text-to-image generation, and use an intent router to activate generation only when needed. Experiments show competitive performance on standard multimodal benchmarks and improved results on physics-oriented evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04804v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[OMNI-Dent: Towards an Accessible and Explainable AI Framework for Automated Dental Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07041v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate dental diagnosis is essential for oral healthcare, yet many individuals lack access to timely professional evaluation. Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals. These approaches also require large amounts of expert-annotated data and often struggle to generalize across diverse real-world imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardReasoner-Omni: A Reasoning-based Multi-modal Guardrail for Text, Image, and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03328v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GuardReasoner-Omni, a reasoning-based guardrail model designed to moderate text, image, and video data. First, we construct a comprehensive training corpus comprising 148k samples spanning these three modalities. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage paradigm to incentivize the model to deliberate before making decisions: (1) conducting SFT to cold-start the model with explicit reasoning capabilities and structural adherence; and (2) performing RL, incorporating an error-driven exploration reward to incentivize deeper reasoning on hard samples. We release a suite of models scaled at 2B and 4B parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GuardReasoner-Omni achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines across various guardrail benchmarks. Notably, GuardReasoner-Omni (2B) significantly surpasses the runner-up by 5.3% F1 score.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-RRM: Advancing Omni Reward Modeling via Automatic Rubric-Grounded Preference Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00846v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet their performance is often capped by the coarse nature of existing alignment techniques. A critical bottleneck remains the lack of effective reward models (RMs): existing RMs are predominantly vision-centric, return opaque scalar scores, and rely on costly human annotations. We introduce \textbf{Omni-RRM}, the first open-source rubric-grounded reward model that produces structured, multi-dimension preference judgments with dimension-wise justifications across \textbf{text, image, video, and audio}. At the core of our approach is \textbf{Omni-Preference}, a large-scale dataset built via a fully automated pipeline: we synthesize candidate response pairs by contrasting models of different capabilities, and use strong teacher models to \emph{reconcile and filter} preferences while providing a modality-aware \emph{rubric-grounded rationale} for each pair. This eliminates the need for human-labeled training preferences. Omni-RRM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning to learn the rubric-grounded outputs, followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) to sharpen discrimination on difficult, low-contrast pairs. Comprehensive evaluations show that Omni-RRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video (80.2\% on ShareGPT-V) and audio (66.8\% on Audio-HH-RLHF) benchmarks, and substantially outperforms existing open-source RMs on image tasks, with a 17.7\% absolute gain over its base model on overall accuracy. Omni-RRM also improves downstream performance via Best-of-$N$ selection and transfers to text-only preference benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Omni-RRM-CC08.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-fMRI: A Universal Atlas-Free fMRI Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23090v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised fMRI foundation models have shown promising transfer performance, yet most rely on predefined region-level parcellations that discard fine-grained voxel information and introduce atlas-dependent biases. We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Alignment Curse: Cross-Modality Jailbreak Transfer in Omni-Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02557v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Omni: A Unified Autoregressive Model for Any-to-Any Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17761v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-directional attention mechanism based on Mamba for speech separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16603v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a selective state-space model (SSM), has emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformers for speech modeling, enabling long-sequence processing with linear complexity. While effective in speech separation, existing approaches, whether in the time or time-frequency domain, typically decompose the input along a single dimension into short one-dimensional sequences before processing them with Mamba, which restricts it to local 1D modeling and limits its ability to capture global dependencies across the 2D spectrogram. In this work, we propose an efficient omni-directional attention (OA) mechanism built upon unidirectional Mamba, which models global dependencies from ten different directions on the spectrogram. We expand the proposed mechanism into two baseline separation models and evaluate on three public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach consistently achieves significant performance gains over the baselines while preserving linear complexity, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FutureOmni: Evaluating Future Forecasting from Omni-Modal Context for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13836v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong omni-modal perception, their ability to forecast future events from audio-visual cues remains largely unexplored, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on retrospective understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni).</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openmoss.github.io/FutureOmni</p></details> |

To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.</p></details> |  |

| **[GraphThinker: Reinforcing Video Reasoning with Event Graph Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17555v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning requires understanding the causal relationships between events in a video. However, such relationships are often implicit and costly to annotate manually. While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods.</p></details> | Under review |

Alongside the model, we construct the EA-Video dataset, a benchmark dataset comprising 130K videos that integrates newly collected samples with curated existing datasets, covering diverse commercial and open-source generators and including unseen-generator splits for rigorous cross-distribution evaluation. Extensive experiments show that EA-Swin achieves 0.97-0.99 accuracy across major generators, outperforming prior SoTA methods (typically 0.8-0.9) by a margin of 5-20%, while maintaining strong generalization to unseen distributions, establishing a scalable and robust solution for modern AI-generated video detection.</p></details> | First preprint |

We propose CPL-VAD, a dual-branch framework with cross pseudo labeling. The binary anomaly detection branch focuses on snippet-level anomaly localization, while the category classification branch leverages vision-language alignment to recognize abnormal event categories. By exchanging pseudo labels, the two branches transfer complementary strengths, combining temporal precision with semantic discrimination. Experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime demonstrate that CPL-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and abnormal category classification.</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |
| **[A Long-term Value Prediction Framework In Video Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17058v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling long-term value (LTV) at the ranking stage of short-video recommendation remains challenging. While delayed feedback and extended engagement have been explored, fine-grained attribution and robust position normalization at billion-scale are still underdeveloped. We propose a practical ranking-stage LTV framework addressing three challenges: position bias, attribution ambiguity, and temporal limitations. (1) Position bias: We introduce a Position-aware Debias Quantile (PDQ) module that normalizes engagement via quantile-based distributions, enabling position-robust LTV estimation without architectural changes. (2) Attribution ambiguity: We propose a multi-dimensional attribution module that learns continuous attribution strengths across contextual, behavioral, and content signals, replacing static rules to capture nuanced inter-video influence. A customized hybrid loss with explicit noise filtering improves causal clarity. (3) Temporal limitations: We present a cross-temporal author modeling module that builds censoring-aware, day-level LTV targets to capture creator-driven re-engagement over longer horizons; the design is extensible to other dimensions (e.g., topics, styles). Offline studies and online A/B tests show significant improvements in LTV metrics and stable trade-offs with short-term objectives. Implemented as task augmentation within an existing ranking model, the framework supports efficient training and serving, and has been deployed at billion-scale in Taobao's production system, delivering sustained engagement gains while remaining compatible with industrial constraints.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Analytic Score Optimization for Multi Dimension Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16856v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is evolving beyond single-number mean opinion score toward richer, multi-faceted evaluations of video content. In this paper, we present a large-scale multi-dimensional VQA dataset UltraVQA that encompasses diverse User-Generated Content~(UGC) annotated across five key quality dimensions: Motion Quality, Motion Amplitude, Aesthetic Quality, Content Quality, and Clarity Quality. Each video in our dataset is scored by over 3 human raters on these dimensions, with fine-grained sub-attribute labels, and accompanied by an explanatory rationale generated by GPT based on the collective human judgments. To better leverage these rich annotations and improve discrete quality score assessment, we introduce Analytic Score Optimization (ASO), a theoretically grounded post-training objective derived for multi-dimensional VQA. By reframing quality assessment as a regularized decision-making process, we obtain a closed-form solution that naturally captures the ordinal nature of human ratings, ensuring alignment with human ranking preferences. In experiments, our method outperforms most baselines including closed-source APIs and open-source models, while also reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in quality prediction. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional, interpretable annotations and reinforcement-based alignment in advancing video quality assessment.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

| **[VideoSketcher: Video Models Prior Enable Versatile Sequential Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15819v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Funny Scene Extraction from Long-form Cinematic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15381v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically extracting engaging and high-quality humorous scenes from cinematic titles is pivotal for creating captivating video previews and snackable content, boosting user engagement on streaming platforms. Long-form cinematic titles, with their extended duration and complex narratives, challenge scene localization, while humor's reliance on diverse modalities and its nuanced style add further complexity. This paper introduces an end-to-end system for automatically identifying and ranking humorous scenes from long-form cinematic titles, featuring shot detection, multimodal scene localization, and humor tagging optimized for cinematic content. Key innovations include a novel scene segmentation approach combining visual and textual cues, improved shot representations via guided triplet mining, and a multimodal humor tagging framework leveraging both audio and text. Our system achieves an 18.3% AP improvement over state-of-the-art scene detection on the OVSD dataset and an F1 score of 0.834 for detecting humor in long text. Extensive evaluations across five cinematic titles demonstrate 87% of clips extracted by our pipeline are intended to be funny, while 98% of scenes are accurately localized. With successful generalization to trailers, these results showcase the pipeline's potential to enhance content creation workflows, improve user engagement, and streamline snackable content generation for diverse cinematic media formats.</p></details> |  |
| **[EventMemAgent: Hierarchical Event-Centric Memory for Online Video Understanding with Adaptive Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15329v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.</p></details> |  |

The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages , 6 figures |
| **[Consistency-Preserving Diverse Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15287v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Loss Knows Best: Detecting Annotation Errors in Videos via Loss Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15154v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yehonathanlitman.github.io/edit_ctrl</p></details> |
| **[AnchorWeave: World-Consistent Video Generation with Retrieved Local Spatial Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14941v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining spatial world consistency over long horizons remains a central challenge for camera-controllable video generation. Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://zunwang1.github.io/AnchorWeave</p></details> |
| **[Adapting VACE for Real-Time Autoregressive Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14381v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe an adaptation of VACE (Video All-in-one Creation and Editing) for real-time autoregressive video generation. VACE provides unified video control (reference guidance, structural conditioning, inpainting, and temporal extension) but assumes bidirectional attention over full sequences, making it incompatible with streaming pipelines that require fixed chunk sizes and causal attention. The key modification moves reference frames from the diffusion latent space into a parallel conditioning pathway, preserving the fixed chunk sizes and KV caching that autoregressive models require. This adaptation reuses existing pretrained VACE weights without additional training. Across 1.3B and 14B model scales, VACE adds 20-30% latency overhead for structural control and inpainting, with negligible VRAM cost relative to the base model. Reference-to-video fidelity is severely degraded compared to batch VACE due to causal attention constraints.

Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> |  |
