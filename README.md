| **[LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on Hidden Layer Temporal Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13154v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at https://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.</p></details> | 25 pages, 16 figures |
| **[HalluDetect: Detecting, Mitigating, and Benchmarking Hallucinations in Conversational Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11619v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in industry but remain prone to hallucinations, limiting their reliability in critical applications. This work addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1 score of 69% outperforming baseline detectors by 25.44%. Benchmarking five chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy (96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy. While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk domains, enhancing trust in LLM-driven assistants. We will release the code and dataset</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages + references + appendix, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[D$^2$HScore: Reasoning-Aware Hallucination Detection via Semantic Breadth and Depth Analysis in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11569v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics. Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)}, a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1) \textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift}, which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[HARP: Hallucination Detection via Reasoning Subspace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11536v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original, filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/davidluciolu/APASI.</p></details> | emnlp 2025 accepted |
| **[Predictable Compression Failures: Why Language Models Actually Hallucinate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models perform near-Bayesian inference yet violate permutation invariance on exchangeable data. We resolve this by showing transformers minimize expected conditional description length (cross-entropy) over orderings, $\mathbb{E}_\pi[\ell(Y \mid \Gamma_\pi(X))]$, which admits a Kolmogorov-complexity interpretation up to additive constants, rather than the permutation-invariant description length $\ell(Y \mid X)$. This makes them Bayesian in expectation, not in realization. We derive (i) a Quantified Martingale Violation bound showing order-induced deviations scale as $O(\log n)$ with constants; (ii) the Expectation-level Decompression Law linking information budgets to reliability for Bernoulli predicates; and (iii) deployable planners (B2T/RoH/ISR) for answer/abstain decisions. Empirically, permutation dispersion follows $a+b\ln n$ (Qwen2-7B $b \approx 0.377$, Llama-3.1-8B $b \approx 0.147$); permutation mixtures improve ground-truth likelihood/accuracy; and randomized dose-response shows hallucinations drop by $\sim 0.13$ per additional nat. A pre-specified audit with a fixed ISR=1.0 achieves near-0\% hallucinations via calibrated refusal at 24\% abstention. The framework turns hallucinations into predictable compression failures and enables principled information budgeting.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10818v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains. The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models (LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps: (1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3) generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages,4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[HalluField: Detecting LLM Hallucinations via Field-Theoretic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10753v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics. Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Hallucination Detection by Inspecting Reasoning Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10004v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data. While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS, an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for real-time detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.</p></details> | under review |
| **[MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in Large Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08538v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-LEAF: Localizing and Correcting Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Layer-to-head Attention Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07864v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then, we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALT-RAG: A Task-Adaptable Framework for Hallucination Detection with Calibrated NLI Ensembles and Abstention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07475v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models. We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark. By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA, and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for balancing model performance with safety requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Symbolic Triggers of Hallucination in Gemma Models Across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09715v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem. However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B, reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities (ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets. These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models, pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such inputs--regardless of their scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Noise to Narrative: Tracing the Origins of Hallucinations in Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06938v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science, business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic quantification of a model's hallucination risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAVE: Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06596v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together, these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass, making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Language Models Hallucinate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[AraHalluEval: A Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation Framework for Arabic LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04656v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

In this work, we propose Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at the TRUST-AI workshop, ECAI 2025</p></details> |

By using the dual formulation of the navigation problem, we incorporate CDFs into the MPC framework, ensuring both convergence and safety in a discrete-time setting. These density functions are endowed with a physical interpretation, where the associated measure signifies the occupancy of system trajectories. Leveraging this occupancy-based perspective, we synthesize safety-critical controllers using the proposed MPC-CDF framework. We illustrate the safety properties of this framework using a unicycle model and compare it with a control barrier function-based method. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in the autonomous safe navigation of an underwater vehicle, which avoids complex and arbitrary obstacles while achieving the desired level of safety.</p></details> |  |

Existing data are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources. Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and critical data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous driving systems.

In this paper we design a two-level control algorithm to improve the safety of heterogeneous networks: first, an access control strategy decreases the heterogeneity of the network depending on actual traffic conditions; then, a speed control strategy mitigates the probability of serious injuries in potential collisions. Both control strategies are designed based on momentum considerations, as this is regarded as the most influential variable to assess injury risk. The road network mobility simulator SUMO is adopted to implement and validate our proposed control strategies.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO) across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety filtering of robotic manipulation under environment uncertainty: a computational approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12674v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation in dynamic and unstructured environments requires safety mechanisms that exploit what is known and what is uncertain about the world. Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic manipulation under uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Converse Control Lyapunov Theorem for Joint Safety and Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12182v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the existence of a strictly compatible pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions is equivalent to the existence of a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety. This characterization complements existing literature on converse Lyapunov functions by establishing a partial differential equation (PDE) characterization with prescribed boundary conditions on the safe set, ensuring that the safe set is exactly certified by this Lyapunov function. The result also implies that if a safety and stability specification cannot be certified by a single Lyapunov function, then any pair of control Lyapunov and control barrier functions necessarily leads to a conflict and cannot be satisfied simultaneously in a robust sense.</p></details> |  |
| **[RailSafeNet: Visual Scene Understanding for Tram Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12125v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU), while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers before dangerous situations escalate.

| **[When Safe Unimodal Inputs Collide: Optimizing Reasoning Chains for Cross-Modal Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12060v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoned Safety Alignment: Ensuring Jailbreak Defense via Answer-Then-Check](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11629v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks. Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm). Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Control with High-Probability Safety Guarantee for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11584v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for nonlinear stochastic systems that ensures safety guarantee with high probability. Unlike most existing stochastic MPC schemes, our method adopts a set-erosion that converts the probabilistic safety constraint into a tractable deterministic safety constraint on a smaller safe set over deterministic dynamics. As a result, our method is compatible with any off-the-shelf deterministic MPC algorithm. The key to the effectiveness of our method is a tight bound on the stochastic fluctuation of a stochastic trajectory around its nominal version. Our method is scalable and can guarantee safety with high probability level (e.g., 99.99%), making it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications involving complex nonlinear dynamics. Rigorous analysis is conducted to establish a theoretical safety guarantee, and numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Type Safety in MPI with Rust: A Statically Verified Approach for RSMPI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10803v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a fundamental tool for building high-performance computing (HPC) applications, enabling efficient communication across distributed systems. Despite its widespread adoption, MPI's low-level interface and lack of built-in type safety make it prone to runtime errors, undefined behavior, and debugging challenges, especially in large-scale applications. Rust, a modern systems programming language, offers a compelling solution with its strong type system, which enforces memory and type safety at compile time without compromising performance. This paper introduces a type-safe communication framework for MPI, built on the RSMPI library, to address the limitations of traditional MPI programming. At its core is the TypedCommunicator, an abstraction that enforces static type safety in point-to-point communication operations. By leveraging Rust's Equivalence trait, our framework guarantees that only compatible types can participate in communication, catching mismatches either at compile time or through runtime validation. The framework supports both single-value and slice-based communication, providing an intuitive API for diverse data structures. Our implementation demonstrates that this approach eliminates common MPI errors, improves developer productivity, and maintains performance, adhering to Rust's principle of zero-cost abstractions. This work lays the foundation for extending type safety to collective operations, advancing the robustness of parallel computing in Rust.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combinatorial Control Barrier Functions: Nested Boolean and p-choose-r Compositions of Safety Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10716v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to Control System Letters (L-CSS) with the possibility of presenting at the American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Safety and Security Analysis of Large Language Models: Risk Profile and Harm Potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10655v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds great potential for society, their vulnerabilities to adversarial manipulation and exploitation can pose serious safety, security, and ethical risks. As new threats continue to emerge, it becomes critically necessary to assess the landscape of LLMs' safety and security against evolving adversarial prompt techniques. To understand the behavior of LLMs, this research provides an empirical analysis and risk profile of nine prominent LLMs, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek V3 (both open-source and online), Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-4o, Grok 3, Llama 4 Scout, Mistral 7B, and Qwen 3 1.7B, against 24 different security and safety categories. These LLMs are evaluated on their ability to produce harmful responses for adversarially crafted prompts (dataset has been made public) for a broad range of safety and security topics, such as promotion of violent criminal behavior, promotion of non-violent criminal activity, societal harms related to safety, illegal sexual content, dangerous code generation, and cybersecurity threats beyond code. Our study introduces the Risk Severity Index (RSI), an agile and scalable evaluation score, to quantify and compare the security posture and creating a risk profile of LLMs. As the LLM development landscape progresses, the RSI is intended to be a valuable metric for comparing the risks of LLMs across evolving threats. This research finds widespread vulnerabilities in the safety filters of the LLMs tested and highlights the urgent need for stronger alignment, responsible deployment practices, and model governance, particularly for open-access and rapidly iterated models.</p></details> |  |

Reliable uncertainty estimation is a crucial task in such settings. Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a recently proposed machine learning foundation model for tabular dataset, which uses a generative transformer architecture. Variational Bayesian Last Layers (VBLL) is a state-of-the-art lightweight variational formulation that effectively improves uncertainty estimation with minimal computational overhead. In this work we aim to evaluate the performance of VBLL integrated with the recently proposed TabPFN in uncertainty calibration. Our experiments, conducted on three benchmark medical tabular datasets, compare the performance of the original TabPFN and the VBLL-integrated version. Contrary to expectations, we observed that original TabPFN consistently outperforms VBLL integrated TabPFN in uncertainty calibration across all datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Hinge-Beam Continuum Robot with Passive Safety Capping for Real-Time Fatigue Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09404v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design, making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments. However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration, while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and (3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures.

| **[YouthSafe: A Youth-Centric Safety Benchmark and Safeguard Model for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08997v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by teenagers and young adults in everyday life, ranging from emotional support and creative expression to educational assistance. However, their unique vulnerabilities and risk profiles remain under-examined in current safety benchmarks and moderation systems, leaving this population disproportionately exposed to harm. In this work, we present Youth AI Risk (YAIR), the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate and improve the safety of youth LLM interactions. YAIR consists of 12,449 annotated conversation snippets spanning 78 fine grained risk types, grounded in a taxonomy of youth specific harms such as grooming, boundary violation, identity confusion, and emotional overreliance. We systematically evaluate widely adopted moderation models on YAIR and find that existing approaches substantially underperform in detecting youth centered risks, often missing contextually subtle yet developmentally harmful interactions. To address these gaps, we introduce YouthSafe, a real-time risk detection model optimized for youth GenAI contexts. YouthSafe significantly outperforms prior systems across multiple metrics on risk detection and classification, offering a concrete step toward safer and more developmentally appropriate AI interactions for young users.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

While existing safety approaches rely on post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning. VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting, Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation, and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory, and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets, establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Factories -- a Manifesto](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08285v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cyber-physical systems are operated by complex software that increasingly takes over safety-critical functions. Software enables rapid iterations and continuous delivery of new functionality that meets the ever-changing expectations of users. As high-speed development requires discipline, rigor, and automation, software factories are used. These entail methods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and pipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge the disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety engineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing safety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable, defining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of documentation - to benefit later. Transferring best practices from software to safety engineering is worth exploring. We advocate for safety factories, which integrate safety tooling and methods into software development pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at The 44th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security (SafeComp 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems Considering Transient Frequency Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07345v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High penetration of renewable energy sources intensifies frequency fluctuations in multi-area power systems, challenging both stability and operational safety. This paper proposes a novel distributed frequency control method that ensures transient frequency safety and enforces generation capacity constraints, while achieving steady-state frequency restoration and optimal economic operation. The method integrates a feedback optimization (FO)-based controller and a safety corrector. The FO-based controller generates reference setpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady state corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety corrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to maintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while respecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational burden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical applicability. Theoretical analysis establishes optimality, asymptotic stability, and transient frequency safety for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies show that, compared with conventional FO-based schemes, the method consistently enforces frequency safety and capacity limits, achieves smaller frequency deviations and faster recovery, thereby demonstrating its practical effectiveness and advantages.</p></details> |  |
