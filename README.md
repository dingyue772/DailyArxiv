| **[PRISM: Projection-based Reward Integration for Scene-Aware Real-to-Sim-to-Real Transfer with Few Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20520v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from few demonstrations to develop policies robust to variations in robot initial positions and object poses is a problem of significant practical interest in robotics. Compared to imitation learning, which often struggles to generalize from limited samples, reinforcement learning (RL) can autonomously explore to obtain robust behaviors. Training RL agents through direct interaction with the real world is often impractical and unsafe, while building simulation environments requires extensive manual effort, such as designing scenes and crafting task-specific reward functions. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that constructs simulation environments based on expert demonstrations by identifying scene objects from images and retrieving their corresponding 3D models from existing libraries. We introduce a projection-based reward model for RL policy training that is supervised by a vision-language model (VLM) using human-guided object projection relationships as prompts, with the policy further fine-tuned using expert demonstrations. In general, our work focuses on the construction of simulation environments and RL-based policy training, ultimately enabling the deployment of reliable robotic control policies in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-Based Interaction For Conversation Recommendation via Generative Reward Model Based Simulated User](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20458v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) use multi-turn interaction to capture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. A fundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user preferences from conversations. User preferences can be multifaceted and complex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with access to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify their true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user experience. To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated user, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user provides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better capture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by generative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the simulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained feedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained feedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified into an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified simulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated user, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted. Furthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw inspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning tasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we propose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation results derived from interaction. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and transferability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward Evaluative Thinking: Meta Policy Optimization with Evolving Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20157v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward-based alignment methods for large language models (LLMs) face two key limitations: vulnerability to reward hacking, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal; and reliance on brittle, labor-intensive prompt engineering when LLMs are used as reward models. We introduce Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a framework that addresses these challenges by integrating a meta-reward model that dynamically refines the reward model's prompt throughout training. In MPO, the meta-reward model monitors the evolving training context and continuously adjusts the reward model's prompt to maintain high alignment, providing an adaptive reward signal that resists exploitation by the policy. This meta-learning approach promotes a more stable policy optimization, and greatly reduces the need for manual reward prompt design. It yields performance on par with or better than models guided by extensively hand-crafted reward prompts. Furthermore, we show that MPO maintains its effectiveness across diverse tasks, such as question answering and mathematical reasoning, without requiring specialized reward designs. Beyond standard RLAIF, MPO's meta-learning formulation is readily extensible to higher-level alignment frameworks. Overall, this method addresses theoretical and practical challenges in reward-based RL alignment for LLMs, paving the way for more robust and adaptable alignment strategies. The code and models will be publicly shared.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Diverse LLM Mathematical Reasoning via Automated PRM-Guided GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19981v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anyprefer: An Agentic Framework for Preference Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19276v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer significantly improves model alignment performance across four main applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and 16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Web GUI Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19237v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated GUI testing of web applications has always been considered a challenging task considering their large state space and complex interaction logic. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a recent extension of Reinforcement Learning (RL), which takes advantage of the powerful learning capabilities of neural networks, making it suitable for complex exploration space. In this paper, leveraging the capability of deep reinforcement learning, we propose WebRLED, an effective approach for automated GUI testing of complex web applications. WebRLED has the following characteristics: (1) a grid-based action value learning technique, which can improve the efficiency of state space exploration; (2) a novel action discriminator which can be trained during the exploration to identify more actions; (3) an adaptive, curiosity-driven reward model, which considers the novelty of an explored state within an episode and global history, and can guide exploration continuously. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of WebRLED on 12 open-source web applications and a field study of the top 50 most popular web applications in the world. The experimental results show that WebRLED achieves higher code/state coverage and failure detection rate compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Furthermore, WebRLED finds 695 unique failures in 50 real-world applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19162v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming state-of-the-art process reward models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://chen-judge.github.io/SPC/</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Round Enhanced Training in Diffusion Models for Improved Preference Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18204v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has significantly changed industries by enabling text-driven image generation, yet challenges remain in achieving high-resolution outputs that align with fine-grained user preferences. Consequently, multi-round interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations. Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions, such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.17660</p></details> |
| **[Process Reward Models That Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16828v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skywork R1V2: Multimodal Hybrid Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16656v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we introduce the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively counters the ``Vanishing Advantages'' dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini. The Skywork R1V2 model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V2-38B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Explainable Dense Reward Shapes via Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16272v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipelines for large language model (LLM) alignment typically assign scalar rewards to sequences, using the final token as a surrogate indicator for the quality of the entire sequence. However, this leads to sparse feedback and suboptimal token-level credit assignment. In this work, we frame reward shaping as an optimization problem focused on token-level credit assignment. We propose a reward-shaping function leveraging explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME to estimate per-token rewards from the reward model. To learn parameters of this shaping function, we employ a bilevel optimization framework that integrates Bayesian Optimization and policy training to handle noise from the token reward estimates. Our experiments show that achieving a better balance of token-level reward attribution leads to performance improvements over baselines on downstream tasks and finds an optimal policy faster during training. Furthermore, we show theoretically that explainability methods that are feature additive attribution functions maintain the optimal policy as the original reward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding VLM Agents with Process Rewards at Inference Time for GUI Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16073v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in visual language models (VLMs) have notably enhanced their capabilities in handling complex Graphical User Interface (GUI) interaction tasks. Despite these improvements, current frameworks often struggle to generate correct actions in challenging GUI environments. State-of-the-art commercial VLMs are black-boxes, and fine-tuning open-source VLMs for GUI tasks requires significant resources. Additionally, existing trajectory-level evaluation and refinement techniques frequently fall short due to delayed feedback and local optimization issues. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that guides VLM agents with process supervision by a reward model during GUI navigation and control at inference time. This guidance allows the VLM agent to optimize actions at each inference step, thereby improving performance in both static and dynamic environments. In particular, our method demonstrates significant performance gains in three GUI navigation tasks, achieving a 3.4% improvement in single step action accuracy for static environments, along with a around 33% increase in task success rate in one dynamic environment. With further integration of trajectory reflection and retry mechanisms, we also demonstrate even greater enhancement in task success.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-DPO: Improving Data Utilization in Direct Preference Optimization Using a Guiding Reference Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15843v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop Summation: Min-Form Credit Assignment Is All Process Reward Model Needs for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15275v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Reliability Metrics for Reward Models in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14838v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reward model (RM) that represents human preferences plays a crucial role in optimizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs), e.g., through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or rejection sampling. However, a long challenge for RM is its uncertain reliability, i.e., LLM outputs with higher rewards may not align with actual human preferences. Currently, there is a lack of a convincing metric to quantify the reliability of RMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textit{\underline{R}eliable at \underline{$\eta$}} (RETA) metric, which directly measures the reliability of an RM by evaluating the average quality (scored by an oracle) of the top $\eta$ quantile responses assessed by an RM. On top of RETA, we present an integrated benchmarking pipeline that allows anyone to evaluate their own RM without incurring additional Oracle labeling costs. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the superior stability of RETA metric, providing solid evaluations of the reliability of various publicly available and proprietary RMs. When dealing with an unreliable RM, we can use the RETA metric to identify the optimal quantile from which to select the responses.</p></details> |  |

Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches often rely on monolithic value representations, limiting their ability to adapt to individual preferences. We introduce a novel framework that leverages low-rank preference modeling to efficiently learn and generalize user-specific reward functions. By representing reward functions in a low-dimensional subspace and modeling individual preferences as weighted combinations of shared basis functions, our approach avoids rigid user categorization while enabling scalability and few-shot adaptation. We validate our method on multiple preference datasets, demonstrating superior generalization to unseen users and improved accuracy in preference prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiGUI-R1: Advancing Multimodal GUI Agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14239v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks.

At the same time, recent breakthroughs in reasoning models, such as Deepseek-R1, unlock the opportunity for reinforcement learning to improve LLM reasoning skills. An in-depth understanding of how ITC interacts with reasoning across different models could provide important guidance on how to further advance the LLM frontier. This work conducts a comprehensive analysis of inference-time scaling methods for both reasoning and non-reasoning models on challenging reasoning tasks. Specifically, we focus our research on verifier-free inference time-scaling methods due to its generalizability without needing a reward model. We construct the Pareto frontier of quality and efficiency. We find that non-reasoning models, even with an extremely high inference budget, still fall substantially behind reasoning models. For reasoning models, majority voting proves to be a robust inference strategy, generally competitive or outperforming other more sophisticated ITC methods like best-of-N and sequential revisions, while the additional inference compute offers minimal improvements. We further perform in-depth analyses of the association of key response features (length and linguistic markers) with response quality, with which we can improve the existing ITC methods. We find that correct responses from reasoning models are typically shorter and have fewer hedging and thinking markers (but more discourse markers) than the incorrect responses.</p></details> |  |

While these LLMs are optimized for a variety of tasks, their exhaustive employment may become computationally or financially cumbersome for small teams. Additionally, complete reliance on proprietary, closed-source models often limits customization and adaptability, posing significant challenges in research and application scalability. Instead, by leveraging open-source models at or below 7 billion parameters, we can optimize our resource usage while still observing remarkable gains over standard prompting approaches. To cultivate this notion, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a simple, zero-shot prompt engineering method that instructs LLMs to create observable subproblems using critical problem-solving, specifically designed to enhance arithmetic reasoning capabilities. When applied to open-source models in tandem with GPT-4, we observe that Trace-of-Thought not only allows novel insight into the problem-solving process but also introduces performance gains as large as 125% on language models at or below 7 billion parameters. This approach underscores the potential of open-source initiatives in democratizing AI research and improving the accessibility of high-quality computational linguistics applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present ChestX-Reasoner, a radiology diagnosis MLLM designed to leverage process supervision mined directly from clinical reports, reflecting the step-by-step reasoning followed by radiologists. We construct a large dataset by extracting and refining reasoning chains from routine radiology reports. Our two-stage training framework combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning guided by process rewards to better align model reasoning with clinical standards. We introduce RadRBench-CXR, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 59K visual question answering samples with 301K clinically validated reasoning steps, and propose RadRScore, a metric evaluating reasoning factuality, completeness, and effectiveness. ChestX-Reasoner outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning ability, achieving 16%, 5.9%, and 18% improvements in reasoning ability compared to the best medical MLLM, the best general MLLM, and its base model, respectively, as well as 3.3%, 24%, and 27% improvements in outcome accuracy.

| **[Enhancing Non-Core Language Instruction-Following in Speech LLMs via Semi-Implicit Cross-Lingual CoT Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20835v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have been extended to the speech domain, leading to the development of speech large language models (SLLMs). While existing SLLMs demonstrate strong performance in speech instruction-following for core languages (e.g., English), they often struggle with non-core languages due to the scarcity of paired speech-text data and limited multilingual semantic reasoning capabilities. To address this, we propose the semi-implicit Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework, which integrates speech-to-text translation into the reasoning process of SLLMs. The XS-CoT generates four types of tokens: instruction and response tokens in both core and non-core languages, enabling cross-lingual transfer of reasoning capabilities. To mitigate inference latency in generating target non-core response tokens, we incorporate a semi-implicit CoT scheme into XS-CoT, which progressively compresses the first three types of intermediate reasoning tokens while retaining global reasoning logic during training. By leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of the core language, XS-CoT improves responses for non-core languages by up to 45\% in GPT-4 score when compared to direct supervised fine-tuning on two representative SLLMs, Qwen2-Audio and SALMONN. Moreover, the semi-implicit XS-CoT reduces token delay by more than 50\% with a slight drop in GPT-4 scores. Importantly, XS-CoT requires only a small amount of high-quality training data for non-core languages by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of core languages. To support training, we also develop a data pipeline and open-source speech instruction-following datasets in Japanese, German, and French.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning Under Memory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20834v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance reasoning within targeted problem spaces in large language models (LLMs) under memory and compute constraints. Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20769v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated great success in facilitating the reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grokking in the Wild: Data Augmentation for Real-World Multi-Hop Reasoning with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20752v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Last Answer: Your Reasoning Trace Uncovers More than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20708v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning trace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its conclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by posing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent the model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different results? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps, termed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach involves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on linguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from the end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer from every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We find that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the mode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on the answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency among the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics that correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting potential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various LLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025) show consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\% and 10\% respectively. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/SubthoughtReasoner.</p></details> | Preprint |

We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap between human and VLM spatial reasoning and makes VLMs more capable in real-world tasks such as robotics and navigation.</p></details> |  |

Existing retrievers have shown limited gains on reasoning tasks, in part because existing training datasets focus on short factual queries tied to documents that straightforwardly answer them. We develop a synthetic data generation pipeline that, for each document, our pipeline creates a challenging and relevant query, along with a plausibly related but ultimately unhelpful hard negative. By training on a mixture of our synthetic data and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a widely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When applied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4% and 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming other retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time compute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases with longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to outperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker. Our training recipe is general and can be easily extended to future LLMs; to this end, we open-source our code, data, and model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is released at \url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/ReasonIR}</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Large Language Models with One Training Example](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20571v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR.

| **[Token-Efficient Prompt Injection Attack: Provoking Cessation in LLM Reasoning via Adaptive Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20493v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks, they also contain notable security vulnerabilities. Recent research has uncovered a "thinking-stopped" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1, where model-generated reasoning tokens can forcibly interrupt the inference process, resulting in empty responses that compromise LLM-integrated applications. However, existing methods triggering this vulnerability require complex mathematical word problems with long prompts--even exceeding 5,000 tokens. To reduce the token cost and formally define this vulnerability, we propose a novel prompt injection attack named "Reasoning Interruption Attack", based on adaptive token compression. We demonstrate that simple standalone arithmetic tasks can effectively trigger this vulnerability, and the prompts based on such tasks exhibit simpler logical structures than mathematical word problems. We develop a systematic approach to efficiently collect attack prompts and an adaptive token compression framework that utilizes LLMs to automatically compress these prompts. Experiments show our compression framework significantly reduces prompt length while maintaining effective attack capabilities. We further investigate the attack's performance via output prefix and analyze the underlying causes of the vulnerability, providing valuable insights for improving security in reasoning LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing data synthesis methods, such as data augmentation from annotated training sets or direct question generation based on relevant knowledge points and documents, have expanded datasets but face challenges in mastering the inner logic of the problem during generation and ensuring the verifiability of the solutions. To address these issues, we propose RV-Syn, a novel Rational and Verifiable mathematical Synthesis approach. RV-Syn constructs a structured mathematical operation function library based on initial seed problems and generates computational graphs as solutions by combining Python-formatted functions from this library. These graphs are then back-translated into complex problems. Based on the constructed computation graph, we achieve solution-guided logic-aware problem generation. Furthermore, the executability of the computational graph ensures the verifiability of the solving process. Experimental results show that RV-Syn surpasses existing synthesis methods, including those involving human-generated problems, achieving greater efficient data scaling. This approach provides a scalable framework for generating high-quality reasoning datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spatial-reasoner.github.io</p></details> |

A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Our results show moral reasoning performance degrades with increasing context complexity, particularly for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. We further fine-tune the open-source LLaMA-3-8B model using curated monolingual data for alignment and poisoning. Surprisingly, low-resource languages have a stronger impact on multilingual reasoning than high-resource ones, highlighting their critical role in multilingual NLP.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations, multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments. Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025 that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research, academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems, multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally, we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial expressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To address this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using de-identified video and audio inputs. The DEEMO dataset consists of two subsets: DEEMO-NFBL, which includes rich annotations of Non-Facial Body Language (NFBL), and DEEMO-MER, an instruction dataset for Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning using identity-free cues. This design supports emotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we propose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates de-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion recognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a significant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in de-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap in de-identity emotion reasoning. Our work contributes to ethical AI by advancing privacy-preserving emotion understanding and promoting responsible affective computing.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods such as feature embedding and reconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with scalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations, leading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally, industrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance, with defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that dynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class imbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms, enabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks. This approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect localization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating mask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this work advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality control in manufacturing.

Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Has b...</summary><p>Has been accepted at "The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)" Link to publication: https://openreview.net/forum?id=IssPhpUsKt</p></details> |

In this paper, we conduct the first systematic and controlled study on the potential privacy risks associated with visual reasoning abilities of ChatGPT o3. We manually collect and construct a dataset comprising 50 real-world images that feature individuals alongside privacy-relevant environmental elements, capturing realistic and sensitive scenarios for analysis. Our experimental evaluation reveals that ChatGPT o3 can predict user locations with high precision, achieving street-level accuracy (within one mile) in 60% of cases. Through analysis, we identify key visual cues, including street layout and front yard design, that significantly contribute to the model inference success. Additionally, targeted occlusion experiments demonstrate that masking critical features effectively mitigates geolocation accuracy, providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. Our findings highlight an urgent need for privacy-aware development for agentic multi-modal large reasoning models, particularly in applications involving private imagery.</p></details> |  |
