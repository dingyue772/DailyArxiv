| **[Hallucination Detection via Internal States and Structured Reasoning Consistency in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11529v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states (Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning (Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable, fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

| **[Trustworthy Retrosynthesis: Eliminating Hallucinations with a Diverse Ensemble of Reaction Scorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10645v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Hallucinations in Authentic LLM-Human Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10539v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task. Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage. To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues, thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in 31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise, their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Images Speak Louder: Mitigating Language Bias-induced Hallucinations in VLMs through Cross-Modal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10466v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning via Functional Attention Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10285v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content. In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division: shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining. Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Functional-Attention-Control.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500 images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available: https://github.com/TruhnLab/VisionSemanticEntropy</p></details> |
| **[On Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Hallucination Detection with Effective Rank-based Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08389v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers. Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules, thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and externally (different responses), providing a justification for using representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios, contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting and Mitigating Insertion Hallucination in Video-to-Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08078v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Hallucinations in Autonomous Vehicles: A Component-Agnostic Safety Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07749v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module, resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic. The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations, such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated, component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 15 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Semantics Tracing: A Framework for Explaining Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06107v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary contributions. First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic failures, we propose Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST), a unified framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context (distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific commitment layer where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic associative pathway (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate, contextual pathway (akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks. Our framework's ability to quantify the coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation ($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the Transformer architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient High-Resolution Image Editing with Hallucination-Aware Loss and Adaptive Tiling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06295v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage. MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g., up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g., a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[ChainMPQ: Interleaved Text-Image Reasoning Chains for Mitigating Relation Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06292v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Geometry of Truth: Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04933v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables.

| **[When Models Lie, We Learn: Multilingual Span-Level Hallucination Detection with PsiloQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04849v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained, multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work, we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models -- and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets. Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained hallucination detection in multilingual settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel hallucination classification framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05189v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses. Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective framework for improving model reliability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[TAG:Tangential Amplifying Guidance for Hallucination-Resistant Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04533v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

| **[Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning-based Safety Guardrails](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11570v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses. The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense, such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series. Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

| **[AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.</p></details> | under review |
| **[DeepResearchGuard: Deep Research with Open-Domain Evaluation and Multi-Stage Guardrails for Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10994v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash, DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, to evaluate whether the intended effects of openness - such as democratization and autonomy - are realized, we need a more holistic approach that considers the context of release: who will reuse the system, for what purposes, and under what conditions. To this end, we adapt five lessons from system safety that offer guidance on how openness can be evaluated at the system level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Symposium on Model Accountability, Sustainability and Healthcare (SMASH) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Steering Over-refusals Towards Safety in Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10452v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals -- where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical, and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement / contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce \textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines while preserving legitimate refusals.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Risk-Budgeted Control Framework for Balanced Performance and Safety in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10442v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk, ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF) to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF constraints. The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC) for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a balance between safety and performance.</p></details> |  |

Its safety guarantees have been extensively examined by the community through empirical studies, which has led to its remarkable success. However, unsafe code remains a critical concern in Rust. By reviewing the safety design of Rust and analyzing real-world Rust projects, this paper establishes a systematic framework for understanding unsafe code and undefined behavior, and summarizes the soundness criteria for Rust code. It further derives actionable guidance for achieving sound encapsulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond ADE and FDE: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Safety-Critical Prediction in Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10086v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution. Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation, contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pharmacist: Safety Alignment Data Curation for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10085v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harmful fine-tuning issues present significant safety challenges for fine-tuning-as-a-service in large language models. Existing alignment-stage defenses, e.g., Vaccine, Repnoise, Booster, and T-Vaccine, mitigate harmful fine-tuning issues by enhancing the model's robustness during the alignment phase. While these methods have been proposed to mitigate the issue, they often overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment data. We observe that their defense performance and computational efficiency remain constrained by the quality and composition of the alignment dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Pharmacist, a safety alignment data curation solution that enhances defense against harmful fine-tuning by selecting a high-quality and safety-critical core subset from the original alignment data. The core idea of Pharmacist is to train an alignment data selector to rank alignment data. Specifically, up-ranking high-quality and safety-critical alignment data, down-ranking low-quality and non-safety-critical data. Empirical results indicate that models trained on datasets selected by Pharmacist outperform those trained on datasets selected by existing selection methods in both defense and inference performance. In addition, Pharmacist can be effectively integrated with mainstream alignment-stage defense methods. For example, when applied to RepNoise and T-Vaccine, using the dataset selected by Pharmacist instead of the full dataset leads to improvements in defense performance by 2.60\% and 3.30\%, respectively, and enhances inference performance by 3.50\% and 1.10\%. Notably, it reduces training time by 56.83\% and 57.63\%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lslland/Pharmacist.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end Compositional Verification of Program Safety through Verified and Verifying Compilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10015v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program safety (i.e., absence of undefined behaviors) is critical for correct operation of computer systems. It is usually verified at the source level (e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers (e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However, modern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving end-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the safe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified compilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at the target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors) are automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for modules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to cooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety. To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of safety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled transition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules and can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those properties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and composition of the safety results at the target level. Open safety can be generalized to partial safety (i.e., only a certain class of errors can occur). By this we formalized the correctness of verifying compilation as derivation of total safety from partial safety. We demonstrate how our framework can combine verified and verifying compilation by developing a verified compiler for an ownership language (called Owlang) inspired by Rust. We evaluate our approach on the compositional safety verification using a hash map implemented by Owlang and C.</p></details> |  |
| **[Path Drift in Large Reasoning Models:How First-Person Commitments Override Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10013v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming, and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates, while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks, we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form reasoning beyond token-level alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Game: Balancing Safe and Informative Conversations with Blackbox Agentic AI using LP Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09330v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Analysis of eVTOL Operations based on STPA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09283v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft are expected to be quieter and more cost-effective than helicopters, offering major economic and social benefits through improved connectivity. Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation. The findings provide regulators with safety considerations that could shape new or updated regulations, compliance methods, and guidance materials for the safe deployment of eVTOLs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoupling Safety into Orthogonal Subspace: Cost-Efficient and Performance-Preserving Alignment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09004v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches. Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[The Alignment Waltz: Jointly Training Agents to Collaborate for Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08240v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content, and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets, demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.</p></details> |  |
| **[CREST-Search: Comprehensive Red-teaming for Evaluating Safety Threats in Large Language Models Powered by Web Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09689v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tasks such as dialogue, summarization, and question answering, yet they struggle to adapt to specialized domains and evolving facts. To overcome this, web search has been integrated into LLMs, allowing real-time access to online content. However, this connection magnifies safety risks, as adversarial prompts combined with untrusted sources can cause severe vulnerabilities. We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such systems. Unlike existing methods for standalone LLMs, CREST-Search addresses the complex workflow of search-enabled models by generating adversarial queries with in-context learning and refining them through iterative feedback. We further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs into efficient red-teaming agents. Experiments show that CREST-Search effectively bypasses safety filters and reveals vulnerabilities in modern web-augmented LLMs, underscoring the need for specialized defenses to ensure trustworthy deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unintended Trade-off of AI Alignment:Balancing Hallucination Mitigation and Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07775v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Injecting Hallucinations in Autonomous Vehicles: A Component-Agnostic Safety Evaluation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07749v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception failures in autonomous vehicles (AV) remain a major safety concern because they are the basis for many accidents. To study how these failures affect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or software components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection studies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module, resulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate into unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by reframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort an AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since hallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables analysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how their faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we propose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework that induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source simulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations were injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic. The results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of each hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations, such as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of collision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress the AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated, component agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and accelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and components. It can potentially reduce the time-to-market of AV and lay the foundation for future research on fault tolerance, and resilient AV design.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 15 figures, 21 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Safety Evaluation in Generative Agent Social Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07709v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions: (1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans. Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75, 55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.</p></details> |  |
