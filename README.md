| **[Hallucinations in Bibliographic Recommendation: Citation Frequency as a Proxy for Training Data Redundancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25378v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination Localization in Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25225v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel task, hallucination localization in video captioning, which aims to identify hallucinations in video captions at the span level (i.e. individual words or phrases). This allows for a more detailed analysis of hallucinations compared to existing sentence-level hallucination detection task. To establish a benchmark for hallucination localization, we construct HLVC-Dataset, a carefully curated dataset created by manually annotating 1,167 video-caption pairs from VideoLLM-generated captions. We further implement a VideoLLM-based baseline method and conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to benchmark current performance on hallucination localization.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs): An Application-Oriented Survey on RAG, Reasoning, and Agentic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24476v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[HACK: Hallucinations Along Certainty and Knowledge Axes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24222v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage. Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis, we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation, which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge categorization by showing a significant difference between the two hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that consider the hallucination underlying factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/HACK_Hallucinations_Along_Certainty_and_Knowledge_axes</p></details> |
| **[Challenging Multilingual LLMs: A New Taxonomy and Benchmark for Unraveling Hallucination in Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24073v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in https://huggingface.co/collections/AIDC-AI/marco-mt.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Reasoning Trap: How Enhancing LLM Reasoning Amplifies Tool Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22977v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench, a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i) no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic, appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that jointly optimize for capability and reliability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Multi-Modal Fact-Verification Framework for Reducing Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22751v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches, and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confabulations from ACL Publications (CAP): A Dataset for Scientific Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22395v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain, where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages (English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages (Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OlaMind: Towards Human-Like and Hallucination-Safe Customer Service for Retrieval-Augmented Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22143v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency. However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Gaze Shifts for Guidance: Cross-Modal Fusion Enhancement for VLM Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22067v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores. However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding, while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterpDetect: Interpretable Signals for Detecting Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21538v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore, classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses, demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs), consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20690v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters, compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically, causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the reliability of language models at fixed budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of Negated Text on Hallucination with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20375v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism? After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses. Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress" framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly, re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaming LLMs to Detect and Mitigate Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19507v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model (LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and under-representation of information required at deployment time among other limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this "consortium consistency" approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 workshop on Reliable ML from Unreliable Data</p></details> |
| **[HAD: HAllucination Detection Language Models Based on a Comprehensive Hallucination Taxonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19318v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models, particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection, span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process. Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains 2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their robustness and versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[JointCQ: Improving Factual Hallucination Detection with Joint Claim and Query Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19310v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues, i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e., claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more trustworthy and transparent language model systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19183v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We propose a spectral analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain" behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75% for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review (2025). 11 pages, 7 figures.

| **[The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Margins of Inverse Optimal ISSf Controllers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26397v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the gain margin of a general nonlinear system under an inverse optimal input-to-state safe (ISSf) controller of the form u=u0(x)+u*(x,u0), where u0 is the nominal control and u* is the inverse optimal safety filter that minimally modifies the nominal controller's unsafe actions over the infinite horizon. By first establishing a converse ISSf-BF theorem, we reveal the equivalence among the achievability of ISSf by feedback, the achievability of inverse optimality, and the solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation associated with the inverse optimal ISSf gain assignment. Then we develop a collection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the absence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers have a certain degree of gain margin. Specifically, when f(x) acts safely but u0 acts unsafely, the gain can be decreased by up to half; and when f(x) acts unsafely, we establish that, if u0 acts safely, the gain can be increased arbitrarily, whereas if u0 acts unsafely, the control recovers the full gain margin [1/2,inf). It is shown, however, that under control gain variation, the safe set of these controllers is locally asymptotically stable, which implies that their safety is sensitive to large but bounded disturbances. To make inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variation, we propose a gain margin improvement approach at the expense of an increased control effort. This improvement allows the inverse optimal safe control to inherit the standard gain margin of [1/2,inf) without requiring prior knowledge of whether f(x) or u0 acts safely on the safety boundary, while simultaneously ensuring global asymptotic stability of the resulting safe set. In the presence of disturbances, this improvement idea renders inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variations with the same gain margin of [1/2,inf).</p></details> |  |
| **[ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard, the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM), which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art.

This work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation -- specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smooth path planning with safety margins using Piece-Wise Bezier curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24972v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient quadratic programming (QP) approach for generating smooth, $C^1$ continuous paths for mobile robots using piece-wise quadratic Bezier (PWB) curves. Our method explicitly incorporates safety margins within a structured optimization framework, balancing trajectory smoothness and robustness with manageable numerical complexity suitable for real-time and embedded applications. Comparative simulations demonstrate clear advantages over traditional piece-wise linear (PWL) path planning methods, showing reduced trajectory deviations, enhanced robustness, and improved overall path quality. These benefits are validated through simulations using a Pure-Pursuit controller in representative scenarios, highlighting the practical effectiveness and scalability of our approach for safe navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Framework with Soft Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24933v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional reachability methods provide formal guarantees of safety under bounded disturbances. However, they strictly enforce state constraints as inviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in complex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such as bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed envelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are inherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined safety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands, albeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This paper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of safety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints. Specifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred to as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed to reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring that cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified budget. The framework comprises two principal components: (i) an augmented-state model with an auxiliary budget state that tracks soft-constraint violations, and (ii) a regularization-based approximation of the discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi value function associated with the reach-avoid differential game studied herein. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical examples involving the landing of a simple point-mass model and a fixed-wing aircraft executing an emergency descent, both under wind disturbances. The simulation results validate the framework's ability to simultaneously manage both hard and soft constraints in safety-critical settings</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeEditor: Unified MLLM for Efficient Post-hoc T2I Safety Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24820v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable safety-utility balance.</p></details> |  |
| **[OS-Sentinel: Towards Safety-Enhanced Mobile GUI Agents via Hybrid Validation in Realistic Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24411v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Advancing Interdisciplinary Approaches to Online Safety Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24227v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing prevalence of negative experiences in online spaces demands urgent attention from the human-computer interaction (HCI) community. However, research on online safety remains fragmented across different HCI subfields, with limited communication and collaboration between disciplines. This siloed approach risks creating ineffective responses, including design solutions that fail to meet the diverse needs of users, and policy efforts that overlook critical usability concerns. This workshop aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue on online safety by bringing together researchers from within and beyond HCI - including but not limited to Social Computing, Digital Design, Internet Policy, Cybersecurity, Ethics, and Social Sciences. By uniting researchers, policymakers, industry practitioners, and community advocates we aim to identify shared challenges in online safety research, highlight gaps in current knowledge, and establish common research priorities. The workshop will support the development of interdisciplinary research plans and establish collaborative environments - both within and beyond Australia - to action them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear effects, exceptions, and resource safety: a Curry-Howard correspondence for destructors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23517v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyse the problem of combining linearity, effects, and exceptions, in abstract models of programming languages, as the issue of providing some kind of strength for a monad $T(- \oplus E)$ in a linear setting. We consider in particular for $T$ the allocation monad, which we introduce to model and study resource-safety properties. We apply these results to a series of two linear effectful calculi for which we establish their resource-safety properties. The first calculus is a linear call-by-push-value language with two allocation effects $\mathit{new}$ and $\mathit{delete}$. The resource-safety properties follow from the linear (and even ordered) character of the typing rules. We then explain how to integrate exceptions on top of linearity and effects by adjoining default destruction actions to types, as inspired by C++/Rust destructors. We see destructors as objects $\delta : A\rightarrow TI$ in the slice category over $TI$. This construction gives rise to a second calculus, an affine ordered call-by-push-value language with exceptions and destructors, in which the weakening rule performs a side-effect. As in C++/Rust, a ``move'' operation is necessary to allow random-order release of resources, as opposed to last-in-first-out order. Moving resources is modelled as an exchange rule that performs a side-effect.</p></details> | 26 pages + appendix |
| **[An Error-Based Safety Buffer for Safe Adaptive Control (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23491v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Guardian: Decoupling Exploration from Safety in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22859v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks, underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and safety in reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ellipsoidal Set-Theoretic Design of Robust Safety Filters for Constrained Linear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22790v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an ellipsoidal set-theoretic framework for robust safety filter synthesis in constrained linear systems subject to additive bounded disturbances and input constraints. We formulate the safety filter design as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem that simultaneously computes a robust controlled invariant (RCI) ellipsoidal set and its associated state-feedback control law. The RCI set is characterized as an ellipsoidal set, enabling computational tractability for high-dimensional systems while providing formal safety guarantees. The safety filter employs a smooth mixing strategy between nominal and backup controllers based on distance to the invariant set boundary, facilitating minimal intervention when the system operates safely. The proposed method extends to nonlinear systems by treating nonlinear terms as bounded disturbances with rigorous approximation bounds. Numerical validation on a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor system demonstrates the filter's effectiveness in maintaining stability under external disturbances and aggressive maneuvers while preserving nominal performance during safe operation. The approach provides a constructive and computationally efficient solution for safety-critical control applications requiring real-time implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIN-LLM: A Safety-Constrained Hybrid Framework for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22609v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty, resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals. Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score, outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Robust Multi-Agent Safety via Tube-Based Tightened Exponential Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22514v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances. The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form, accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF) constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IFAC for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[T2I-RiskyPrompt: A Benchmark for Safety Evaluation, Attack, and Defense on Text-to-Image Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22300v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using risky text prompts, such as pornography and violent prompts, to test the safety of text-to-image (T2I) models is a critical task. However, existing risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas: 1) limited risky categories, 2) coarse-grained annotation, and 3) low effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce T2I-RiskyPrompt, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating safety-related tasks in T2I models. Specifically, we first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy, which consists of 6 primary categories and 14 fine-grained subcategories. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts. Finally, we obtain 6,432 effective risky prompts, where each prompt is annotated with both hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons. Moreover, to facilitate the evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that explicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense methods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key insights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety. Finally, we discuss potential applications of T2I-RiskyPrompt across various research fields. The dataset and code are provided in https://github.com/datar001/T2I-RiskyPrompt.</p></details> | AAAI under review |
| **[Auction-Based Responsibility Allocation for Scalable Decentralized Safety Filters in Cooperative Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21546v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a scalable decentralized safety filter for multi-agent systems based on high-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) and auction-based responsibility allocation. While decentralized HOCBF formulations ensure pairwise safety under input bounds, they face feasibility and scalability challenges as the number of agents grows. Each agent must evaluate an increasing number of pairwise constraints, raising the risk of infeasibility and making it difficult to meet real-time requirements. To address this, we introduce an auction-based allocation scheme that distributes constraint enforcement asymmetrically among neighbors based on local control effort estimates. The resulting directed responsibility graph guarantees full safety coverage while reducing redundant constraints and per-agent computational load. Simulation results confirm safe and efficient coordination across a range of network sizes and interaction densities.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to Control Engineering Practice and IFAC World Congress 2026</p></details> |

Existing mitigation strategies rely on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

We develop a Kriging approach in the Wasserstein space, leveraging the quantile function representation of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. To mitigate the inaccuracies in semivariogram estimation that arise from sparse datasets, we combine this formulation with cross-validation techniques. In particular, we introduce a variant of the virtual cross-validation formulas tailored to quantile functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a controlled toy problem as well as on a real-world application from nuclear safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection for Safety Assurance of AI and Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21254v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research, development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.</p></details> |  |
