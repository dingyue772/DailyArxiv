| **[Listwise Preference Alignment Optimization for Tail Item Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02255v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models (LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training. Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations. Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yuhanleeee/LPO4Rec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling with Reflective Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01951v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model (SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emotionally Intelligent Task-oriented Dialogue Systems: Architecture, Representation, and Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01594v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural, representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end \textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for next-generation conversational agents.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Self-Guided Process Reward Optimization with Redefined Step-wise Advantage for Process Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01551v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward \textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and \textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately $1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking. Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Reward Models for Few-Shot Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01368v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning. Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format. Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skywork-Reward-V2: Scaling Preference Data Curation via Human-AI Synergy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01352v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LitBench: A Benchmark and Dataset for Reliable Evaluation of Creative Writing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00769v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased, human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii) conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences; among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and reward models at https://huggingface.co/collections/SAA-Lab/litbench-68267b5da3aafe58f9e43461, providing a vetted resource for reliable, automated evaluation and optimization of creative writing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFER: Probing Safety in Reward Models with Sparse Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00665v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/xzy-101/SAFER-code. \textit{This paper discusses topics related to large language model safety and may include discussions or examples that highlight potential risks or unsafe outcomes.}</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual Reward Models for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00611v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network, using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at https://sunlighted.github.io/RRM-web/.</p></details> | 26 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Generalist Reward Models: Found Inside Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23235v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory, demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training, heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment as well as multi-modal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting LLM's Molecular Structure Elucidation with Knowledge Enhanced Tree Search Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23056v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular structure elucidation involves deducing a molecule's structure from various types of spectral data, which is crucial in chemical experimental analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in analyzing and reasoning through complex tasks, they still encounter substantial challenges in molecular structure elucidation. We identify that these challenges largely stem from LLMs' limited grasp of specialized chemical knowledge. In this work, we introduce a Knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework for Molecular Structure Elucidation (K-MSE), leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search for test-time scaling as a plugin. Specifically, we construct an external molecular substructure knowledge base to extend the LLMs' coverage of the chemical structure space. Furthermore, we design a specialized molecule-spectrum scorer to act as a reward model for the reasoning process, addressing the issue of inaccurate solution evaluation in LLMs. Experimental results show that our approach significantly boosts performance, particularly gaining more than 20% improvement on both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o. Our code is available at https://github.com/HICAI-ZJU/K-MSE.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22832v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost at the Beginning of Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22058v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[TROFI: Trajectory-Ranked Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22008v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video game development, the availability of the reward function is not always guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies. Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment. Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Reinforcement Learning and Video Games Workshop at RLC 2025</p></details> |
| **[PrefPaint: Enhancing Image Inpainting through Expert Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21834v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical, inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training. We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEEA-R1: Tree-Structured Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Self-Evolving Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21669v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon, real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents. Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19% (multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent-RewardBench: Towards a Unified Benchmark for Reward Modeling across Perception, Planning, and Safety in Real-World Multimodal Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21252v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence. However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling.

| **[Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for the Future under Non-Stationarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20417v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture \textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example, seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data. Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under non-stationarity for various experimental setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ctrl-Z Sampling: Diffusion Sampling with Controlled Random Zigzag Explorations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20294v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by progressively denoising Gaussian noise toward a target data distribution. This denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned latent space, where the model iteratively refines the sample toward regions of higher probability. However, diffusion models often converge to local optima that are locally visually coherent yet globally inconsistent or conditionally misaligned, due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. Prior efforts attempted to address this by strengthening guidance signals or manipulating the initial noise distribution. We introduce Controlled Random Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy designed to detect and escape such local maxima during conditional generation. The method first identifies potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon detection, it injects noise and reverts to a previous, noisier state to escape the current optimization plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories, accepting only those that offer improvement, while progressively deeper retreat enables stronger escapes when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled random zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the generated outputs. The proposed Ctrl-Z Sampling is model-agnostic and compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 7.6X increase in function evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO for Dynamic Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19780v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision. Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss. However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment settings. In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, appendix included.

However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints, and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities, enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
