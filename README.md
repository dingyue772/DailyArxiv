| **[MetaRAG: Metamorphic Testing for Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09360v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e., confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches, such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time, unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g., pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility), allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.</p></details> | under review |

| **[A Hybrid Hinge-Beam Continuum Robot with Passive Safety Capping for Real-Time Fatigue Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09404v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design, making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments. However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration, while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and (3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Safety and Helpfulness using SFT and DPO: A Study on OPT-350M](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09055v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset, we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model, and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures.

| **[YouthSafe: A Youth-Centric Safety Benchmark and Safeguard Model for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08997v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by teenagers and young adults in everyday life, ranging from emotional support and creative expression to educational assistance. However, their unique vulnerabilities and risk profiles remain under-examined in current safety benchmarks and moderation systems, leaving this population disproportionately exposed to harm. In this work, we present Youth AI Risk (YAIR), the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate and improve the safety of youth LLM interactions. YAIR consists of 12,449 annotated conversation snippets spanning 78 fine grained risk types, grounded in a taxonomy of youth specific harms such as grooming, boundary violation, identity confusion, and emotional overreliance. We systematically evaluate widely adopted moderation models on YAIR and find that existing approaches substantially underperform in detecting youth centered risks, often missing contextually subtle yet developmentally harmful interactions. To address these gaps, we introduce YouthSafe, a real-time risk detection model optimized for youth GenAI contexts. YouthSafe significantly outperforms prior systems across multiple metrics on risk detection and classification, offering a concrete step toward safer and more developmentally appropriate AI interactions for young users.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning. VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting, Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation, and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory, and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets, establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Factories -- a Manifesto](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08285v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern cyber-physical systems are operated by complex software that increasingly takes over safety-critical functions. Software enables rapid iterations and continuous delivery of new functionality that meets the ever-changing expectations of users. As high-speed development requires discipline, rigor, and automation, software factories are used. These entail methods and tools used for software development, such as build systems and pipelines. To keep up with the rapid evolution of software, we need to bridge the disconnect in methods and tools between software development and safety engineering today. We need to invest more in formality upfront - capturing safety work products in semantically rich models that are machine-processable, defining automatic consistency checks, and automating the generation of documentation - to benefit later. Transferring best practices from software to safety engineering is worth exploring. We advocate for safety factories, which integrate safety tooling and methods into software development pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at The 44th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security (SafeComp 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems Considering Transient Frequency Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07345v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High penetration of renewable energy sources intensifies frequency fluctuations in multi-area power systems, challenging both stability and operational safety. This paper proposes a novel distributed frequency control method that ensures transient frequency safety and enforces generation capacity constraints, while achieving steady-state frequency restoration and optimal economic operation. The method integrates a feedback optimization (FO)-based controller and a safety corrector. The FO-based controller generates reference setpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady state corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety corrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to maintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while respecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational burden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical applicability. Theoretical analysis establishes optimality, asymptotic stability, and transient frequency safety for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies show that, compared with conventional FO-based schemes, the method consistently enforces frequency safety and capacity limits, achieves smaller frequency deviations and faster recovery, thereby demonstrating its practical effectiveness and advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeToolBench: Pioneering a Prospective Benchmark to Evaluating Tool Utilization Safety in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07315v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited great performance in autonomously calling various tools in external environments, leading to better problem solving and task automation capabilities. However, these external tools also amplify potential risks such as financial loss or privacy leakage with ambiguous or malicious user instructions. Compared to previous studies, which mainly assess the safety awareness of LLMs after obtaining the tool execution results (i.e., retrospective evaluation), this paper focuses on prospective ways to assess the safety of LLM tool utilization, aiming to avoid irreversible harm caused by directly executing tools. To this end, we propose SafeToolBench, the first benchmark to comprehensively assess tool utilization security in a prospective manner, covering malicious user instructions and diverse practical toolsets. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, SafeInstructTool, which aims to enhance LLMs' awareness of tool utilization security from three perspectives (i.e., \textit{User Instruction, Tool Itself, and Joint Instruction-Tool}), leading to nine detailed dimensions in total. We experiment with four LLMs using different methods, revealing that existing approaches fail to capture all risks in tool utilization. In contrast, our framework significantly enhances LLMs' self-awareness, enabling a more safe and trustworthy tool utilization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Anchoring Refusal Direction: Mitigating Safety Risks in Tuning via Projection Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06795v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions, raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states, which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training, which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios, and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance. Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Meets Speed: Accelerated Neural MPC with Safety Guarantees and No Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06404v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enforces safety via constraints, its real-time execution can exceed embedded compute budgets. We propose a Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) framework that synergizes neural networks' fast computation with MPC's constraint-handling capability. To ensure strict safety, we replace traditional Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for collision avoidance. We integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the optimization objective of a Short-horizon MPC, substantially reducing online computational complexity. Additionally, we use a second neural network to learn the sensitivity of the value function to system parameters, and adaptively adjust the neural value function based on this neural sensitivity when model parameters change, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing offline computation costs. The hardware in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on Jetson Nano show that BAN-MPC solves 200 times faster than traditional MPC, enabling collision-free navigation with control error below 5\% under model parameter variations within 15\%, making it an effective embedded MPC alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, accepted to RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Embedding Poisoning: Bypassing Safety Alignment via Embedding Semantic Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06338v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread distribution of Large Language Models (LLMs) through public platforms like Hugging Face introduces significant security challenges. While these platforms perform basic security scans, they often fail to detect subtle manipulations within the embedding layer. This work identifies a novel class of deployment phase attacks that exploit this vulnerability by injecting imperceptible perturbations directly into the embedding layer outputs without modifying model weights or input text. These perturbations, though statistically benign, systematically bypass safety alignment mechanisms and induce harmful behaviors during inference. We propose Search based Embedding Poisoning(SEP), a practical, model agnostic framework that introduces carefully optimized perturbations into embeddings associated with high risk tokens. SEP leverages a predictable linear transition in model responses, from refusal to harmful output to semantic deviation to identify a narrow perturbation window that evades alignment safeguards. Evaluated across six aligned LLMs, SEP achieves an average attack success rate of 96.43% while preserving benign task performance and evading conventional detection mechanisms. Our findings reveal a critical oversight in deployment security and emphasize the urgent need for embedding level integrity checks in future LLM defense strategies.</p></details> | 16 pages,9 figures |
| **[Preventing Another Tessa: Modular Safety Middleware For Health-Adjacent AI Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07022v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was suspended after providing harmful weight-loss advice to vulnerable users-an avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency, outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls. The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages content, 1 page reference, 1 figure, Accepted at AAAI Fall Symposium Series</p></details> |
| **[Towards an Automated Framework to Audit Youth Safety on TikTok](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05838v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the effectiveness of TikTok's enforcement mechanisms for limiting the exposure of harmful content to youth accounts. We collect over 7000 videos, classify them as harmful vs not-harmful, and then simulate interactions using age-specific sockpuppet accounts through both passive and active engagement strategies. We also evaluate the performance of large language (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in detecting harmful content, identifying key challenges in precision and scalability. Preliminary results show minimal differences in content exposure between adult and youth accounts, raising concerns about the platform's age-based moderation. These findings suggest that the platform needs to strengthen youth safety measures and improve transparency in content moderation.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to EMNLP 2025 and ECAT Research Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[ThreatGPT: An Agentic AI Framework for Enhancing Public Safety through Threat Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05379v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As our cities and communities become smarter, the systems that keep us safe, such as traffic control centers, emergency response networks, and public transportation, also become more complex. With this complexity comes a greater risk of security threats that can affect not just machines but real people's lives. To address this challenge, we present ThreatGPT, an agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant built to help people whether they are engineers, safety officers, or policy makers to understand and analyze threats in public safety systems. Instead of requiring deep cybersecurity expertise, it allows users to simply describe the components of a system they are concerned about, such as login systems, data storage, or communication networks. Then, with the click of a button, users can choose how they want the system to be analyzed by using popular frameworks such as STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE reports, NIST, or CISA. ThreatGPT is unique because it does not just provide threat information, but rather it acts like a knowledgeable partner. Using few-shot learning, the AI learns from examples and generates relevant smart threat models. It can highlight what might go wrong, how attackers could take advantage, and what can be done to prevent harm. Whether securing a city's infrastructure or a local health service, this tool adapts to users' needs. In simple terms, ThreatGPT brings together AI and human judgment to make our public systems safer. It is designed not just to analyze threats, but to empower people to understand and act on them, faster, smarter, and with more confidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models in Disaster Tweet Classification for Public Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04650v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, using only data and convex optimization tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML, existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Safety-Critical Control of Resilient DC Microgrids with Large-Signal Stability Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03789v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. Conventional droop-based methods remain prevalent due to their simplicity, yet their design is largely empirical and conservative, lacking rigorous guarantees. Advanced strategies improve certain aspects, but often sacrifice scalability, robustness, or formal safety. In this work, we propose a Distributed Safety-Critical Controller (DSCC) that systematically integrates global stabilization with formal safety guarantees in a fully decentralized manner. Leveraging control barrier functions and the port-Hamiltonian system theory, the DSCC achieves scalable safe stabilization while preserving real-time implementability. High-fidelity switched-circuit simulations validate the controller's advantages under various contingencies. This framework paves the way for resilient, safety-critical, and scalable control in next-generation DC microgrids.</p></details> |  |

Traditional assessment methodologies are not geared toward evaluating AI-based functions and require evolving standards and practices. This paper explores how an independent assessment of an AI component in an EV can be achieved when combining ISO 26262 with the recently released ISO/PAS 8800, whose scope is AI safety for road vehicles. The AI-driven State of Charge (SOC) battery estimation exemplifies the process. Key features relevant to the independent assessment of this extended evaluation approach are identified. As part of the evaluation, robustness testing of the AI component is conducted using fault injection experiments, wherein perturbed sensor inputs are systematically introduced to assess the component's resilience to input variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, EVS38, https://evs38-program.org/en/evs-38-proceedings/all</p></details> |
| **[Parallel-Constraint Model Predictive Control: Exploiting Parallel Computation for Improving Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03261v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.</p></details> |  |
