| **[Learning to Reason for Hallucination Span Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02173v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluGuard: Evidence-Grounded Small Reasoning Models to Mitigate Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00880v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and (iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy (BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copy-Paste to Mitigate Large Language Model Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00508v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context, leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM, obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation.

| **[Beyond Token Probes: Hallucination Detection via Activation Tensors with ACT-ViT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00296v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens) and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning. Full code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/ACT-ViT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points for Navigation in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26513v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of possible obstacle trajectories. Inspired by hallucination-based data synthesis approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points (LfH-CP), a self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic obstacle datasets based on existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive expert demonstrations or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes hallucination into two stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must appear in order to result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points, and then procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these points while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures such as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We further introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that LfH-CP produces substantially more varied training data than existing baselines. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on LfH-CP datasets achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination method.</p></details> |  |
| **[GroundSight: Augmenting Vision-Language Models with Grounding Information and De-hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25669v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79% to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceDet: Hallucination Detection from the Decoding Trace of Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01274v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations. To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Message-Passing on Attention Graphs for Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24770v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content, known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 25 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Visual Hallucinations via Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24491v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Hallucination Detection: HSAD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23580v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Self-Consistency as a Free Lunch: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23236v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses, which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2 to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Fine-Grained Detection of Context-Grounded Hallucinations Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22582v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment with the model's parametric knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Textual Context: Structural Graph Encoding with Adaptive Space Alignment to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22251v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then, the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available at https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Library Hallucinations in LLMs: Risk Analysis Grounded in Developer Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22202v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 tables |
| **[Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented. Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[UpSafe$^\circ$C: Upcycling for Controllable Safety in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02194v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment -- each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model, and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Control Barrier Functions: A Path Towards Nonparametric Safety Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02127v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of complex dynamical systems often relies on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Both methods require computing a function that characterizes a safe set that can be made (control) invariant. However, the computational burden of solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (for HJ Reachability) or large-scale semidefinite programs (for CBFs) makes finding such functions challenging. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Recurrent Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs), a novel class of CBFs that leverages a recurrent property of the trajectories, i.e., coming back to a safe set, for safety verification. Under mild assumptions, we show that the RCBF condition holds for the signed-distance function, turning function design into set identification. Notably, the resulting set need not be invariant to certify safety. We further propose a data-driven nonparametric method to compute safe sets that is massively parallelizable and trades off conservativeness against computational cost.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |
| **[AdvEvo-MARL: Shaping Internalized Safety through Adversarial Co-Evolution in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01586v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[InvThink: Towards AI Safety via Inverse Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01569v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable Design Approach to Resilient Architectures for Interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems: Safety Guarantees under Multiple Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01541v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex, interconnected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly prevalent in domains such as power systems. Cyber-resilient architectures have been proposed to recover compromised cyber components of CPS. Recent works have studied tuning the recovery times of such architectures to guarantee safety in single-system settings. Extending these designs to interconnected CPS is more challenging, since solutions must account for attacks on multiple subsystems that can occur in any order and potentially infinite possible temporal overlap. This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenge by developing a scalable framework to assign resilient architectures and to inform the tuning of their recovery times. Our approach introduces a scalar index that quantifies the impact of each subsystem on safety under compromised input. These indices aggregate linearly across subsystems, enabling scalable analysis under arbitrary attack orderings and temporal overlaps. We establish a linear inequality relating each subsystem's index and recovery time that guarantees safety and guides resilient architecture assignment. We also propose a segmentation-based approach to strengthen the previously derived conditions. We then present algorithms to compute the proposed indices and to find a cost-optimal architecture assignment with a safety guarantee. We validate the framework through a case study on temperature regulation in interconnected rooms under different attack scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Modeling and Explainable AI for Veterinary Safety Profiles, Residue Assessment, and Health Outcomes Using Real-World Data and Physicochemical Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01520v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed, and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best, achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost. Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors, including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate, interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles, strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Control Barrier Functions: Safety in Probability for Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01501v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control systems operating in the real world face countless sources of unpredictable uncertainties. These random disturbances can render deterministic guarantees inapplicable and cause catastrophic safety failures. To overcome this, this paper proposes a method for designing safe controllers for discrete-time stochastic systems that retain probabilistic guarantees of safety. To do this we modify the traditional notion of a control barrier function (CBF) to explicitly account for these stochastic uncertainties and call these new modified functions probabilistic CBFs. We show that probabilistic CBFs can be used to design controllers that guarantee safety over a finite number of time steps with a prescribed probability. Next, by leveraging various uncertainty quantification methods, such as concentration inequalities, the scenario approach, and conformal prediction, we provide a variety of sufficient conditions that result in computationally tractable controllers with tunable probabilistic guarantees across a plethora of practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase the applicability of our results in simulation and hardware for the control of a quadruped robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Control via Recurrent Tracking Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01147v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs), which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control $\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs' effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.</p></details> | 7 Pages, 2 Figures |
| **[Safety Instincts: LLMs Learn to Trust Their Internal Compass for Self-Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01088v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManagerBench: Evaluating the Safety-Pragmatism Trade-off in Autonomous LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00857v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical. Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

| **[Robust Safety-Critical Control of Integrator Chains with Mismatched Perturbations via Linear Time-Varying Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26629v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel safety-critical control framework for a chain of integrators subject to both matched and mismatched perturbations. The core of our approach is a linear, time-varying state-feedback design that simultaneously enforces stability and safety constraints. By integrating backstepping techniques with a quadratic programming (QP) formulation, we develop a systematic procedure to guarantee safety under time-varying gains. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for the double integrator case, both in the presence and absence of perturbations, and outline general proofs for extending the methodology to higher-order chains of integrators. This proposed framework thus bridges robustness and safety-critical performance, while overcoming the limitations of existing prescribed-time approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable Framework for Safety Assurance of Self-Driving Vehicles based on Assurance 2.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00092v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assurance 2.0 is a modern framework developed to address the assurance challenges of increasingly complex, adaptive, and autonomous systems. Building on the traditional Claims-Argument-Evidence (CAE) model, it introduces reusable assurance theories and explicit counterarguments (defeaters) to enhance rigor, transparency, and adaptability. It supports continuous, incremental assurance, enabling innovation without compromising safety. However, limitations persist in confidence measurement, residual doubt management, automation support, and the practical handling of defeaters and confirmation bias. This paper presents \textcolor{black}{a set of decomposition frameworks to identify a complete set of safety arguments and measure their corresponding evidence.} Grounded in the Assurance 2.0 paradigm, the framework is instantiated through a structured template and employs a three-tiered decomposition strategy. \textcolor{black}{A case study regarding the application of the decomposition framework in the end-to-end (E2E) AI-based Self-Driving Vehicle (SDV) development is also presented in this paper.} At the top level, the SDV development is divided into three critical phases: Requirements Engineering (RE), Verification and Validation (VnV), and Post-Deployment (PD). Each phase is further decomposed according to its Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC). To ensure comprehensive coverage, each PDLC is analyzed using an adapted 5M1E model (Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement, and Environment). Originally developed for manufacturing quality control, the 5M1E model is reinterpreted and contextually mapped to the assurance domain. This enables a multi-dimensional decomposition that supports fine-grained traceability of safety claims, evidence, and potential defeaters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Linear Probes: Dynamic Safety Monitoring for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26238v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at http://github.com/james-oldfield/tpc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://james-oldfield.github.io/tpc</p></details> |
| **[SafeEvalAgent: Toward Agentic and Self-Evolving Safety Evaluation of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26100v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However, existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of advanced AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeMind: Benchmarking and Mitigating Safety Risks in Embodied LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25885v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal, and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations. Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk, Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm, privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion. Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human vs. AI Safety Perception? Decoding Human Safety Perception with Eye-Tracking Systems, Street View Images, and Explainable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25457v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The way residents perceive safety plays an important role in how they use public spaces. Studies have combined large-scale street view images and advanced computer vision techniques to measure the perception of safety of urban environments. Despite their success, such studies have often overlooked the specific environmental visual factors that draw human attention and trigger people's feelings of safety perceptions. In this study, we introduce a computational framework that enriches the existing body of literature on place perception by using eye-tracking systems with street view images and deep learning approaches. Eye-tracking systems quantify not only what users are looking at but also how long they engage with specific environmental elements. This allows us to explore the nuance of which visual environmental factors influence human safety perceptions. We conducted our research in Helsingborg, Sweden, where we recruited volunteers outfitted with eye-tracking systems. They were asked to indicate which of the two street view images appeared safer. By examining participants' focus on specific features using Mean Object Ratio in Highlighted Regions (MoRH) and Mean Object Hue (MoH), we identified key visual elements that attract human attention when perceiving safe environments. For instance, certain urban infrastructure and public space features draw more human attention while the sky is less relevant in influencing safety perceptions. These insights offer a more human-centered understanding of which urban features influence human safety perceptions. Furthermore, we compared the real human attention from eye-tracking systems with attention maps obtained from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) results. Several XAI models were tested, and we observed that XGradCAM and EigenCAM most closely align with human safety perceptual patterns.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Infrastructure Sensor-enabled Vehicle Data Generation using Multi-Sensor Fusion for Proactive Safety Applications at Work Zone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25452v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry, occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth, demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Trustworthy Lexical Simplification: Exploring Safety and Efficiency with Small LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25086v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS), particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications. Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a promising approach for safe real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Input-Constrained Nonlinear Intercept Guidance in Multiple Engagement Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25053v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable. The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function (log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.</p></details> |  |
