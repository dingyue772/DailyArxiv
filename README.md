| **[MIRAGE-Bench: LLM Agent is Hallucinating and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21017v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii) environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/mirage-bench.git</p></details> |
| **[FRED: Financial Retrieval-Enhanced Detection and Editing of Hallucinations in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20930v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8% improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2% drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/pegasi-ai/fine-grained-editting.</p></details> |  |
| **[First Hallucination Tokens Are Different from Conditional Ones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20836v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.</p></details> | <details><summary>4.5 p...</summary><p>4.5 pages, 3 figures, Dataset, Knowledge Paper, Hallucination, Trustworthiness</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Hallucination Detection via Future Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20546v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Stage Verification-Centric Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-Modal RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/KDD-Cup-2025-Meta-CRAG-MM .</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD C...</summary><p>KDD Cup 2025 Meta CRAG-MM Challenge</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Geospatial Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models: Benchmarking and Dynamic Factuality Aligning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19586v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However, LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across 20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge. Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[VisHall3D: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion from Reconstructing the Visible Regions to Hallucinating the Invisible Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19188v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods. VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions (hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly improved reconstruction quality. The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LISA: A Layer-wise Integration and Suppression Approach for Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19110v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and \textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully \textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by 4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multimodal Hallucination Evaluation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19024v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination, producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text (I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation. Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection methods, and outline potential directions for future research.</p></details> | 33 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ICR Probe: Tracking Hidden State Dynamics for Reliable Hallucination Detection in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16488v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream), which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Extracting Visual Facts from Intermediate Layers for Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15652v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs. However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers. Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly, EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mitigation of Hallucination for LLM-empowered Agents: Progressive Generalization Bound Exploration and Watchdog Monitor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15903v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a popular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI deployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are inconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the credibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the intelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk. Therefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to ensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches either depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify hallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent agents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the generalization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations without requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a probabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient number of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently identifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing approaches in hallucination monitoring. Its black-box nature and superior performance make HalMit a promising solution for enhancing the dependability of LLM-powered systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination Score: Towards Mitigating Hallucinations in Generative Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14367v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity. Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI), is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a "Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions to mitigate hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[CCL-XCoT: An Efficient Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer Method for Mitigating Hallucination Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14239v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations, which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations via Sentence-Level Early Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12455v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose SENTINEL (Sentence-level Early iNtervention Through IN-domain prEference Learning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90% compared to the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/pspdada/SENTINEL.</p></details> |  |
| **[RODS: Robust Optimization Inspired Diffusion Sampling for Detecting and Reducing Hallucination in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12201v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations, often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCA-LLaVA: Manhattan Causal Attention for Reducing Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09184v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations pose a significant challenge in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), with misalignment between multimodal features identified as a key contributing factor. This paper reveals the negative impact of the long-term decay in Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), used for positional modeling in LVLMs, on multimodal alignment. Concretely, under long-term decay, instruction tokens exhibit uneven perception of image tokens located at different positions within the two-dimensional space: prioritizing image tokens from the bottom-right region since in the one-dimensional sequence, these tokens are positionally closer to the instruction tokens. This biased perception leads to insufficient image-instruction interaction and suboptimal multimodal alignment. We refer to this phenomenon as image alignment bias. To enhance instruction's perception of image tokens at different spatial locations, we propose MCA-LLaVA, based on Manhattan distance, which extends the long-term decay to a two-dimensional, multi-directional spatial decay. MCA-LLaVA integrates the one-dimensional sequence order and two-dimensional spatial position of image tokens for positional modeling, mitigating hallucinations by alleviating image alignment bias. Experimental results of MCA-LLaVA across various hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. The code can be accessed in https://github.com/ErikZ719/MCA-LLaVA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond vividness: Content analysis of induced hallucinations reveals the hidden structure of individual differences in visual imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09011v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A rapidly alternating red and black display known as Ganzflicker induces visual hallucinations that reflect the generative capacity of the visual system. Recent proposals regarding the imagery spectrum, that is, differences in the visual system of individuals with absent imagery, typical imagery, and vivid imagery, suggest these differences should impact the complexity of other internally generated visual experiences. Here, we used tools from natural language processing to analyze free-text descriptions of hallucinations from over 4,000 participants, asking whether people with different imagery phenotypes see different things in their mind's eye during Ganzflicker-induced hallucinations. Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while weak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision language models better captured these differences than text-only language models, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer sensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in coordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for the imagery spectrum.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoRAG-LoRA: Hallucination-Triggered Knowledge Retuning via Lightweight Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10586v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations - factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Security Tensors as a Cross-Modal Bridge: Extending Text-Aligned Safety to Vision in LVLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20994v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models (LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii) general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs, thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes and data are available at https://github.com/listen0425/Security-Tensors</p></details> |
| **[Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate* utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness, low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step, self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal, the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF, which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs. Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.</p></details> | 14 pages |

For automated driving systems, in particular, further assurance challenges result from the open context that the systems need to operate in after deployment. The current standardization and regulation landscape for ``AI-based'' systems is becoming ever more complex, as standards and regulations are being released at high frequencies. This position paper seeks to provide guidance for making qualified arguments which standards should meaningfully be applied to (``AI-based'') automated driving systems. Furthermore, we argue for clearly differentiating sources of risk between AI-specific and general uncertainties related to the open context. In our view, a clear conceptual separation can help to exploit commonalities that can close the gap between system-level and AI-specific safety analyses, while ensuring the required rigor for engineering safe ``AI-based'' systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, to be published in 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC)</p></details> |
| **[HJB-based online safety-embedded critic learning for uncertain systems with self-triggered mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20545v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a learning-based optimal control framework for safety-critical systems with parametric uncertainties, addressing both time-triggered and self-triggered controller implementations. First, we develop a robust control barrier function (RCBF) incorporating Lyapunov-based compensation terms to rigorously guarantee safety despite parametric uncertainties. Building on this safety guarantee, we formulate the constrained optimal control problem as the minimization of a novel safety-embedded value function, where the RCBF is involved via a Lagrange multiplier that adaptively balances safety constraints against optimal stabilization objectives. To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a self-triggered implementation mechanism that reduces control updates while maintaining dual stability-safety guarantees. The resulting self-triggered constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is solved through an online safety-embedded critic learning framework, with the Lagrange multiplier computed in real time to ensure safety. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving both safety and control performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Blessing and Curse of Dimensionality in Safety Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20333v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering, to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

Industry 5.0, advocating human-centricity, has catalysed increasing adoption of direct measurement tools in manufacturing industries. However, due to technical and feasibility constraints in their practical implementations, especially within non routine manufacturing processes, task based approach to ergonomic assessment is utilized. Despite enabling operationalization of robust ergonomic assessment technologies within complicated industrial processes, task based approach raises several validity concerns. Hence, to ascertain functional utility of the resultant safety interventions, this study evaluates the construct validity of task based ergonomic assessment within non routine work utilizing Multitrait multimethod (MTMM) matrix followed by video-based content analysis. Ergonomic exposure traits were collected for 46 participants through direct measurement and self reported techniques utilizing inertial motion capture and Borg's RPE rating scale respectively. Findings include unsubstantiated convergent validity (low same trait correlations from 0.149 to 0.243) and weak evidence of discriminant validity with statistical significance (p value less than 0.001). The study also identifies three primary factors undermining construct validity through video based content analysis. Findings also elucidate misinterpretation of ergonomic risk and action levels. Therefore, practical implications entail underestimation of actual ergonomic risks when estimated through task based assessment. This highlights the need for enhancement in ergonomic assessment technologies focused on cumulative load analysis compatible within diverse industrial processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relating System Safety and Machine Learnt Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20135v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction quality of machine learnt models and the functionality they ultimately enable (e.g., object detection), is typically evaluated using a variety of quantitative metrics that are specified in the associated model performance requirements. When integrating such models into aeronautical applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values. Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability, and the implications for verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, Expanded version of the paper: G.

PAD introduces Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs. Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size, LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure deployment of diffusion-based language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-Aware Representation Filtering: Purifying Finetuning Data to Preserve LLM Safety Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18631v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With rapid advancement and increasing accessibility of LLMs, fine-tuning aligned models has become a critical step for adapting them to real-world applications, which makes the safety of this fine-tuning process more important than ever. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical challenge: even when fine-tuning with seemingly benign downstream datasets, the safety of aligned LLMs can be compromised, making them more susceptible to malicious instructions. In this paper, we show that fine-tuning datasets often contain samples with safety-degrading features that are not easily identifiable on the surface. These samples can significantly degrade the safety alignment of LLMs during fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose LARF, a Layer-Aware Representation Filtering method. This method identifies safety-sensitive layers within the LLM and leverages their representations to detect which data samples in the post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features. Experimental results demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign data with safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety alignment degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code at https://github.com/LLLeoLi/LARF.</p></details> |  |

It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 18 figures, authors are listed in alphabetical order by their last names; v2 modifies minor issues</p></details> |

However, the need for post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation. This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert, succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data, which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance. This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine safety surveillance from ED triage notes.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Safety Assurance for Quadrotor Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17679v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous drones have gained considerable attention for applications in real-world scenarios, such as search and rescue, inspection, and delivery. As their use becomes ever more pervasive in civilian applications, failure to ensure safe operation can lead to physical damage to the system, environmental pollution, and even loss of human life. Recent work has demonstrated that motion planning techniques effectively generate a collision-free trajectory during navigation. However, these methods, while creating the motion plans, do not inherently consider the safe operational region of the system, leading to potential safety constraints violation during deployment. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages run time safety assurance in a kinodynamic motion planning scheme to satisfy the system's operational constraints. First, we use a sampling-based geometric planner to determine a high-level collision-free path within a user-defined space. Second, we design a low-level safety assurance filter to provide safety guarantees to the control input of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed with the purpose of trajectory tracking. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a restricted 3D simulation environment using a model of the Crazyflie 2.0 drone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 2025 Modeling, Estimation and Control Conference (MECC)</p></details> |

The architecture of recent autonomous systems are trending toward end-to-end (E2E) monolithic architectures such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). In this paper, we review different architectural solutions and then evaluate the efficacy of common safety analyses such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). We show how these techniques can be improved for the intricate nature of the foundational models, particularly in how they form and utilize latent representations. We introduce HySAFE-AI, Hybrid Safety Architectural Analysis Framework for AI Systems, a hybrid framework that adapts traditional methods to evaluate the safety of AI systems. Lastly, we offer hints of future work and suggestions to guide the evolution of future AI safety standards.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[LoRA is All You Need for Safety Alignment of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17075v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning LLMs have demonstrated remarkable breakthroughs in solving complex problems that were previously out of reach. To ensure LLMs do not assist with harmful requests, safety alignment fine-tuning is necessary in the post-training phase. However, safety alignment fine-tuning has recently been shown to significantly degrade reasoning abilities, a phenomenon known as the "Safety Tax". In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets effectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning capabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a low-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our extensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding show that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels comparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning abilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with smaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We also explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or during weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks. We hope this result motivates designing approaches that yield more consistent improvements in the reasoning-safety trade-off.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Resilient Safety-driven Unlearning for Diffusion Models against Downstream Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16302v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity, they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation, ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets, fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

| **["Just a strange pic": Evaluating 'safety' in GenAI Image safety annotation tasks from diverse annotators' perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16033v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what constitutes safety in AI-generated content is complex. While developers often rely on predefined taxonomies, real-world safety judgments also involve personal, social, and cultural perceptions of harm. This paper examines how annotators evaluate the safety of AI-generated images, focusing on the qualitative reasoning behind their judgments. Analyzing 5,372 open-ended comments, we find that annotators consistently invoke moral, emotional, and contextual reasoning that extends beyond structured safety categories. Many reflect on potential harm to others more than to themselves, grounding their judgments in lived experience, collective risk, and sociocultural awareness. Beyond individual perceptions, we also find that the structure of the task itself -- including annotation guidelines -- shapes how annotators interpret and express harm. Guidelines influence not only which images are flagged, but also the moral judgment behind the justifications. Annotators frequently cite factors such as image quality, visual distortion, and mismatches between prompt and output as contributing to perceived harm dimensions, which are often overlooked in standard evaluation frameworks. Our findings reveal that existing safety pipelines miss critical forms of reasoning that annotators bring to the task. We argue for evaluation designs that scaffold moral reflection, differentiate types of harm, and make space for subjective, context-sensitive interpretations of AI-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society 2025 (AIES 2025)</p></details> |
| **[SIA: Enhancing Safety via Intent Awareness for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16856v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in aligning VLMs with human-centric values.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

We propose a novel learning-based explicit MPC structure, which is reformulated into a dual-mode scheme over maximal constrained feasible set. The scheme ensuring the learning-based explicit MPC reduces to linear feedback control while entering the neighborhood of origin. We construct a safety governor to ensure that learning-based explicit MPC satisfies all the state and input constraints. Compare to the existing approach, our approach is computationally easier to implement even in high-dimensional system. The proof of recursive feasibility for the safety governor is given. Our approach is demonstrated on numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Controller Synthesis for Stochastic Networked Systems under Communication Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15031v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a framework for synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time stochastic linear control systems (dt-SLS) operating under communication imperfections. The control unit is remote and communicates with the sensor and actuator through an imperfect wireless network. We consider a constant delay in the sensor-to-controller channel (uplink), and data loss in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator (downlink) channels. In our proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent Bernoulli-distributed random process. To systematically handle the uplink delay, we first introduce an augmented discrete-time stochastic linear system (dt-ASLS) by concatenating all states and control inputs that sufficiently represent the state-input evolution of the original dt-SLS under the delay and packet loss constraints. We then leverage control barrier certificates (CBCs) for dt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that guarantees dt-SLS safety in a stochastic sense, ensuring that all trajectories of dt-SLS remain within safe regions with a quantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safety constraints into matrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem that eventually quantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specification in the presence of communication imperfections. We validate our results on an RLC circuit subject to both constant delay and probabilistic data loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaAlign: Incentivizing Safety Alignment with Extremely Simplified Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14987v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.} AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages: (1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals, while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on shallow refusal patterns.</p></details> |  |
