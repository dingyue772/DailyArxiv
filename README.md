| **[Graph-Grounded LLMs: Leveraging Graphical Function Calling to Minimize LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10941v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly expanding across various tasks that involve inherent graphical structures. Graphs are integral to a wide range of applications, including motion planning for autonomous vehicles, social networks, scene understanding, and knowledge graphs. Many problems, even those not initially perceived as graph-based, can be effectively addressed through graph theory. However, when applied to these tasks, LLMs often encounter challenges, such as hallucinations and mathematical inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph-Grounded LLMs, a system that improves LLM performance on graph-related tasks by integrating a graph library through function calls. By grounding LLMs in this manner, we demonstrate significant reductions in hallucinations and improved mathematical accuracy in solving graph-based problems, as evidenced by the performance on the NLGraph benchmark. Finally, we showcase a disaster rescue application where the Graph-Grounded LLM acts as a decision-support system.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALURust: Exploiting Hallucinations of Large Language Models to Detect Vulnerabilities in Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10793v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an emerging programming language, Rust has rapidly gained popularity and recognition among developers due to its strong emphasis on safety. It employs a unique ownership system and safe concurrency practices to ensure robust safety. Despite these safeguards, security in Rust still presents challenges. Since 2018, 442 Rust-related vulnerabilities have been reported in real-world applications. The limited availability of data has resulted in existing vulnerability detection tools performing poorly in real-world scenarios, often failing to adapt to new and complex vulnerabilities. This paper introduces HALURust, a novel framework that leverages hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) to detect vulnerabilities in real-world Rust scenarios. HALURust leverages LLMs' strength in natural language generation by transforming code into detailed vulnerability analysis reports. The key innovation lies in prompting the LLM to always assume the presence of a vulnerability. If the code sample is vulnerable, the LLM provides an accurate analysis; if not, it generates a hallucinated report. By fine-tuning LLMs on these hallucinations, HALURust can effectively distinguish between vulnerable and non-vulnerable code samples. HALURust was evaluated on a dataset of 81 real-world vulnerabilities, covering 447 functions and 18,691 lines of code across 54 applications. It outperformed existing methods, achieving an F1 score of 77.3%, with over 10% improvement. The hallucinated report-based fine-tuning improved detection by 20\% compared to traditional code-based fine-tuning. Additionally, HALURust effectively adapted to unseen vulnerabilities and other programming languages, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[TruthPrInt: Mitigating LVLM Object Hallucination Via Latent Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10602v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Hallucination (OH) has been acknowledged as one of the major trustworthy challenges in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TruthPrInt.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, the first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Through the Magnifying Glass: Adaptive Perception Magnification for Hallucination-Free VLM Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10183v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by reducing biases contrastively or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches improve visual perception at the cost of impairing the language reasoning capability. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. Specifically, by magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ShunqiM/PM .</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Is LLMs Hallucination Usable? LLM-based Negative Reasoning for Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09153v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The questionable responses caused by knowledge hallucination may lead to LLMs' unstable ability in decision-making. However, it has never been investigated whether the LLMs' hallucination is possibly usable to generate negative reasoning for facilitating the detection of fake news. This study proposes a novel supervised self-reinforced reasoning rectification approach - SR$^3$ that yields both common reasonable reasoning and wrong understandings (negative reasoning) for news via LLMs reflection for semantic consistency learning. Upon that, we construct a negative reasoning-based news learning model called - \emph{NRFE}, which leverages positive or negative news-reasoning pairs for learning the semantic consistency between them. To avoid the impact of label-implicated reasoning, we deploy a student model - \emph{NRFE-D} that only takes news content as input to inspect the performance of our method by distilling the knowledge from \emph{NRFE}. The experimental results verified on three popular fake news datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with three kinds of baselines including prompting on LLMs, fine-tuning on pre-trained SLMs, and other representative fake news detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-guided Attention Map Editing: Towards Efficient Contextual Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08963v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In tasks like summarization and open-book question answering (QA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter "contextual hallucination", where they produce irrelevant or incorrect responses despite having access to accurate source information. This typically occurs because these models tend to prioritize self-generated content over the input context, causing them to disregard pertinent details. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method called "Guided Attention Map Editing" (GAME), which dynamically adjusts attention maps to improve contextual relevance. During inference, GAME employs a trained classifier to identify attention maps prone to inducing hallucinations and executes targeted interventions. These interventions, guided by gradient-informed "edit directions'', strategically redistribute attention weights across various heads to effectively reduce hallucination. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging summarization and open-book QA tasks show that GAME consistently reduces hallucinations across a variety of open-source models. Specifically, GAME reduces hallucinations by 10% in the XSum summarization task while achieving a 7X speed-up in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Finding of NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Attention Reallocation: Towards Zero-cost and Controllable Hallucination Mitigation of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08342v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand out in various tasks but still struggle with hallucinations. While recent training-free mitigation methods mostly introduce additional inference overhead via retrospection strategy and contrastive decoding, we propose attention reallocation (AttnReal) to mitigate hallucinations with nearly zero extra cost. Our approach is motivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention distribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which further contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap between different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles excessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens, which reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding process depends more on the visual inputs. More interestingly, we find that, by controlling the intensity of AttnReal, we can achieve a wide-range trade-off between the response faithfulness and overall performance. Comprehensive results from different benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AttnReal across six open-source MLLMs and three decoding strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Hijackers: Detect and Disentangle Attention Hijacking in LVLMs for Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08216v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their success, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucinations. While existing studies attribute the cause of hallucinations to insufficient visual attention to image tokens, our findings indicate that hallucinations also arise from interference from instruction tokens during decoding. Intuitively, certain instruction tokens continuously distort LVLMs' visual perception during decoding, hijacking their visual attention toward less discriminative visual regions. This distortion prevents them integrating broader contextual information from images, ultimately leading to hallucinations. We term this phenomenon 'Attention Hijacking', where disruptive instruction tokens act as 'Attention Hijackers'. To address this, we propose a novel, training-free strategy namely Attention HIjackers Detection and Disentanglement (AID), designed to isolate the influence of Hijackers, enabling LVLMs to rely on their context-aware intrinsic attention map. Specifically, AID consists of three components: First, Attention Hijackers Detection identifies Attention Hijackers by calculating instruction-driven visual salience. Next, Attention Disentanglement mechanism is proposed to mask the visual attention of these identified Hijackers, and thereby mitigate their disruptive influence on subsequent tokens. Finally, Re-Disentanglement recalculates the balance between instruction-driven and image-driven visual salience to avoid over-masking effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AID significantly reduces hallucination across various LVLMs on several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluVerse25: Fine-grained Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for LLM Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07833v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various contexts, yet remain prone to generating non-factual content, commonly referred to as "hallucinations". The literature categorizes hallucinations into several types, including entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. However, existing hallucination datasets often fail to capture fine-grained hallucinations in multilingual settings. In this work, we introduce HalluVerse25, a multilingual LLM hallucination dataset that categorizes fine-grained hallucinations in English, Arabic, and Turkish. Our dataset construction pipeline uses an LLM to inject hallucinations into factual biographical sentences, followed by a rigorous human annotation process to ensure data quality. We evaluate several LLMs on HalluVerse25, providing valuable insights into how proprietary models perform in detecting LLM-generated hallucinations across different contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[EAZY: Eliminating Hallucinations in LVLMs by Zeroing out Hallucinatory Image Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07772v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable potential, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still face challenges with object hallucination, a problem where their generated outputs mistakenly incorporate objects that do not actually exist. Although most works focus on addressing this issue within the language-model backbone, our work shifts the focus to the image input source, investigating how specific image tokens contribute to hallucinations. Our analysis reveals a striking finding: a small subset of image tokens with high attention scores are the primary drivers of object hallucination. By removing these hallucinatory image tokens (only 1.5% of all image tokens), the issue can be effectively mitigated. This finding holds consistently across different models and datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce EAZY, a novel, training-free method that automatically identifies and Eliminates hAllucinations by Zeroing out hallucinatorY image tokens. We utilize EAZY for unsupervised object hallucination detection, achieving 15% improvement compared to previous methods. Additionally, EAZY demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations while preserving model utility and seamlessly adapting to various LVLM architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in YOLO-based Object Detection Models: A Revisit to Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07330v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments. Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K. Our code and dataset are available at: https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/dnn-safety/m-hood.</p></details> |  |
| **[PerturboLLaVA: Reducing Multimodal Hallucinations with Perturbative Visual Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06486v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims to address the challenge of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) particularly for dense image captioning tasks. To tackle the challenge, we identify the current lack of a metric that finely measures the caption quality in concept level. We hereby introduce HalFscore, a novel metric built upon the language graph and is designed to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of dense captions at a granular level. Additionally, we identify the root cause of hallucination as the model's over-reliance on its language prior. To address this, we propose PerturboLLaVA, which reduces the model's reliance on the language prior by incorporating adversarially perturbed text during training. This method enhances the model's focus on visual inputs, effectively reducing hallucinations and producing accurate, image-grounded descriptions without incurring additional computational overhead. PerturboLLaVA significantly improves the fidelity of generated captions, outperforming existing approaches in handling multimodal hallucinations and achieving improved performance across general multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Treble Counterfactual VLMs: A Causal Approach to Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06169v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TREE985/Treble-Counterfactual-VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wireless Hallucination in Generative AI-enabled Communications: Concepts, Issues, and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06149v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) is driving the intelligence of wireless communications. Due to data limitations, random generation, and dynamic environments, GenAI may generate channel information or optimization strategies that violate physical laws or deviate from actual real-world requirements. We refer to this phenomenon as wireless hallucination, which results in invalid channel information, spectrum wastage, and low communication reliability but remains underexplored. To address this gap, this article provides a comprehensive concept of wireless hallucinations in GenAI-driven communications, focusing on hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental, analyze its causes based on the GenAI workflow, and propose mitigation solutions at the data, model, and post-generation levels. Then, we systematically examines representative hallucination scenarios in GenAI-enabled communications and their corresponding solutions. Finally, we propose a novel integrated mitigation solution for GenAI-based channel estimation. At the data level, we establish a channel estimation hallucination dataset and employ generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data augmentation. Additionally, we incorporate attention mechanisms and large language models (LLMs) to enhance both training and inference performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid solutions reduce the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by 0.19, effectively reducing wireless hallucinations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[SINdex: Semantic INconsistency Index for Hallucination Detection in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05980v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, yet they are prone to generating factually incorrect outputs - commonly known as "hallucinations." Among existing mitigation strategies, uncertainty-based methods are particularly attractive due to their ease of implementation, independence from external data, and compatibility with standard LLMs. In this work, we introduce a novel and scalable uncertainty-based semantic clustering framework for automated hallucination detection. Our approach leverages sentence embeddings and hierarchical clustering alongside a newly proposed inconsistency measure, SINdex, to yield more homogeneous clusters and more accurate detection of hallucination phenomena across various LLMs. Evaluations on prominent open- and closed-book QA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves AUROC improvements of up to 9.3% over state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component in our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[HalluCounter: Reference-free LLM Hallucination Detection in the Wild!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04615v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Response consistency-based, reference-free hallucination detection (RFHD) methods do not depend on internal model states, such as generation probabilities or gradients, which Grey-box models typically rely on but are inaccessible in closed-source LLMs. However, their inability to capture query-response alignment patterns often results in lower detection accuracy. Additionally, the lack of large-scale benchmark datasets spanning diverse domains remains a challenge, as most existing datasets are limited in size and scope. To this end, we propose HalluCounter, a novel reference-free hallucination detection method that utilizes both response-response and query-response consistency and alignment patterns. This enables the training of a classifier that detects hallucinations and provides a confidence score and an optimal response for user queries. Furthermore, we introduce HalluCounterEval, a benchmark dataset comprising both synthetically generated and human-curated samples across multiple domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin, achieving over 90\% average confidence in hallucination detection across datasets.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TPC: Cross-Temporal Prediction Connection for Vision-Language Model Hallucination Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04457v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, capitalizing on the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks. Despite this, a critical challenge known as hallucination occurs when models overconfidently describe objects or attributes absent from the image, a problem exacerbated by the tendency of VLMs to rely on linguistic priors. This limitation reduces model reliability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we have observed the characteristic of logits' continuity consistency enhancement and introduced a straightforward and efficient method, Cross-Temporal Prediction Connection (TPC), designed to enhance the semantic consistency of logits by connecting them temporally across timesteps. TPC amplifies information flow and improves coherence, effectively reducing hallucination. Extensive experiments show that TPC surpasses existing representatives, delivering superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency while maintaining robustness in open-ended text generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding Text Hallucination of Diffusion Models via Local Generation Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03595v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have achieved incredible performance in generating realistic images, audio, and video data. While these models produce high-quality samples with impressive details, they often introduce unrealistic artifacts, such as distorted fingers or hallucinated texts with no meaning. This paper focuses on textual hallucinations, where diffusion models correctly generate individual symbols but assemble them in a nonsensical manner. Through experimental probing, we consistently observe that such phenomenon is attributed it to the network's local generation bias. Denoising networks tend to produce outputs that rely heavily on highly correlated local regions, particularly when different dimensions of the data distribution are nearly pairwise independent. This behavior leads to a generation process that decomposes the global distribution into separate, independent distributions for each symbol, ultimately failing to capture the global structure, including underlying grammar. Intriguingly, this bias persists across various denoising network architectures including MLP and transformers which have the structure to model global dependency. These findings also provide insights into understanding other types of hallucinations, extending beyond text, as a result of implicit biases in the denoising models. Additionally, we theoretically analyze the training dynamics for a specific case involving a two-layer MLP learning parity points on a hypercube, offering an explanation of its underlying mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring Decoding: Mitigating Hallucination via Evaluating the Factuality of Partial Response during Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03106v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, they remain susceptible to hallucinations -- generating plausible yet factually incorrect contents. Existing methods to mitigating such risk often rely on sampling multiple full-length generations, which introduces significant response latency and becomes ineffective when the model consistently produces hallucinated outputs with high confidence. To address these limitations, we introduce Monitoring Decoding (MD), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the generation process and selectively applies in-process interventions, focusing on revising crucial tokens responsible for hallucinations. Instead of waiting until completion of multiple full-length generations, we identify hallucination-prone tokens during generation using a monitor function, and further refine these tokens through a tree-based decoding strategy. This approach ensures an enhanced factual accuracy and coherence in the generated output while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MD consistently outperforms self-consistency-based approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher factual accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

| **[CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10391v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 14.3% compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Density Principle for MLLM Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10079v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hundreds of benchmarks have been developed to ensure the reliability of MLLMs in downstream tasks. However, the evaluation mechanism itself may not be reliable. For developers of MLLMs, questions remain about which benchmark to use and whether the test results meet their requirements. Therefore, we propose a critical principle of Information Density, which examines how much insight a benchmark can provide for the development of MLLMs. We characterize it from four key dimensions: (1) Fallacy, (2) Difficulty, (3) Redundancy, (4) Diversity. Through a comprehensive analysis of more than 10,000 samples, we measured the information density of 19 MLLM benchmarks. Experiments show that using the latest benchmarks in testing can provide more insight compared to previous ones, but there is still room for improvement in their information density. We hope this principle can promote the development and application of future MLLM benchmarks. Project page: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/bench4bench</p></details> |  |
| **[UVE: Are MLLMs Unified Evaluators for AI-Generated Videos?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09949v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/UVE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exo2Ego: Exocentric Knowledge Guided MLLM for Egocentric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09143v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI personal assistants, deployed through robots or wearables, require embodied understanding to collaborate effectively with humans. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on third-person (exocentric) vision, overlooking the unique aspects of first-person (egocentric) videos. Additionally, high acquisition costs limit data size, impairing MLLM performance. To address these challenges, we propose learning the mapping between exocentric and egocentric domains, leveraging the extensive exocentric knowledge within existing MLLMs to enhance egocentric video understanding. To this end, we introduce Ego-ExoClip, a pre-training dataset comprising 1.1M synchronized ego-exo clip-text pairs derived from Ego-Exo4D. Our approach features a progressive training pipeline with three stages: Teacher Self-Preparation, Teacher-Student Guidance, and Student Self-Practice. Additionally, we propose an instruction-tuning data EgoIT from multiple sources to strengthen the model's instruction-following capabilities, along with the EgoBench benchmark comprising eight different tasks for thorough evaluation. Extensive experiments across diverse egocentric tasks reveal that existing MLLMs perform inadequately in egocentric video understanding, while our model significantly outperforms these leading models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://egovisiongroup.github.io/Exo2Ego.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SegAgent: Exploring Pixel Understanding Capabilities in MLLMs by Imitating Human Annotator Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08625v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While MLLMs have demonstrated adequate image understanding capabilities, they still struggle with pixel-level comprehension, limiting their practical applications. Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |
| **[KAP: MLLM-assisted OCR Text Enhancement for Hybrid Retrieval in Chinese Non-Narrative Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08452v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Knowledge-Aware Preprocessing (KAP), a two-stage preprocessing framework tailored for Traditional Chinese non-narrative documents, designed to enhance retrieval accuracy in Hybrid Retrieval systems. Hybrid Retrieval, which integrates Sparse Retrieval (e.g., BM25) and Dense Retrieval (e.g., vector embeddings), has become a widely adopted approach for improving search effectiveness. However, its performance heavily depends on the quality of input text, which is often degraded when dealing with non-narrative documents such as PDFs containing financial statements, contractual clauses, and tables. KAP addresses these challenges by integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with LLM-driven post-OCR processing, refining extracted text to reduce OCR noise, restore table structures, and optimize text format. By ensuring better compatibility with Hybrid Retrieval, KAP improves the accuracy of both Sparse and Dense Retrieval methods without modifying the retrieval architecture itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention Reallocation: Towards Zero-cost and Controllable Hallucination Mitigation of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08342v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand out in various tasks but still struggle with hallucinations. While recent training-free mitigation methods mostly introduce additional inference overhead via retrospection strategy and contrastive decoding, we propose attention reallocation (AttnReal) to mitigate hallucinations with nearly zero extra cost. Our approach is motivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention distribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which further contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap between different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles excessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens, which reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding process depends more on the visual inputs. More interestingly, we find that, by controlling the intensity of AttnReal, we can achieve a wide-range trade-off between the response faithfulness and overall performance. Comprehensive results from different benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AttnReal across six open-source MLLMs and three decoding strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProJudge: A Multi-Modal Multi-Discipline Benchmark and Instruction-Tuning Dataset for MLLM-based Process Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06553v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors when solving scientific problems, evaluating the validity of their reasoning processes is critical for ensuring reliability and uncovering fine-grained model weaknesses. Since human evaluation is laborious and costly, prompting MLLMs as automated process judges has become a common practice. However, the reliability of these model-based judges remains uncertain. To address this, we introduce ProJudgeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of MLLM-based process judges. ProJudgeBench comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning four scientific disciplines with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content. In ProJudgeBench, each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of judges' capabilities to detect, classify and diagnose errors. Evaluation on ProJudgeBench reveals a significant performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we further propose ProJudge-173k, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a Dynamic Dual-Phase fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to explicitly reason through problem-solving before assessing solutions. Both contributions significantly enhance the process evaluation capabilities of open-source models. All the resources will be released to foster future research of reliable multi-modal process evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

While these applications have been helpful, prior work has found that users remain unsatisfied by their frequent errors. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual interpretation applications, and they show promise for more descriptive visual interpretations. However, it is still unknown how this advancement has changed people's use of these applications. To address this gap, we conducted a two-week diary study in which 20 BLV people used an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application we developed, and we collected 553 entries. In this paper, we report a preliminary analysis of 60 diary entries from 6 participants. We found that participants considered the application's visual interpretations trustworthy (mean 3.75 out of 5) and satisfying (mean 4.15 out of 5). Moreover, participants trusted our application in high-stakes scenarios, such as receiving medical dosage advice. We discuss our plan to complete our analysis to inform the design of future MLLM-enabled visual interpretation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, to appear at CHI 2025</p></details> |

A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, overlooking the challenges and opportunities of multimodal contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the multimodal citation text generation ability of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. We comprehensively evaluate models from multiple dimensions, including citation quality, source reliability, and answer accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs struggle with multimodal citation text generation. We also conduct deep analyses of models' performance, revealing that the bottleneck lies in attributing the correct sources rather than understanding the multimodal content.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunBench: Benchmarking Fundus Reading Skills of MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00901v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in medical image analysis. However, their capabilities in interpreting fundus images, a critical skill for ophthalmology, remain under-evaluated. Existing benchmarks lack fine-grained task divisions and fail to provide modular analysis of its two key modules, i.e., large language model (LLM) and vision encoder (VE). This paper introduces FunBench, a novel visual question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate MLLMs' fundus reading skills. FunBench features a hierarchical task organization across four levels (modality perception, anatomy perception, lesion analysis, and disease diagnosis). It also offers three targeted evaluation modes: linear-probe based VE evaluation, knowledge-prompted LLM evaluation, and holistic evaluation. Experiments on nine open-source MLLMs plus GPT-4o reveal significant deficiencies in fundus reading skills, particularly in basic tasks such as laterality recognition. The results highlight the limitations of current MLLMs and emphasize the need for domain-specific training and improved LLMs and VEs.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. To advance this field, we introduce a new REC dataset with two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject non-existent targets, an often-overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. To address fine-grained compositional REC, we propose novel methods based on a Specialist-MLLM collaboration framework, leveraging the complementary strengths of them: Specialist Models handle simpler tasks efficiently, while MLLMs are better suited for complex reasoning. Based on this synergy, we introduce two collaborative strategies. The first, Slow-Fast Adaptation (SFA), employs a routing mechanism to adaptively delegate simple tasks to Specialist Models and complex tasks to MLLMs. Additionally, common error patterns in both models are mitigated through a target-refocus strategy. The second, Candidate Region Selection (CRS), generates multiple bounding box candidates based on Specialist Model and uses the advanced reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to identify the correct target. Extensive experiments on our dataset and other challenging compositional benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The SFA strategy achieves a trade-off between localization accuracy and efficiency, and the CRS strategy greatly boosts the performance of both Specialist Models and MLLMs. We aim for this work to offer valuable insights into solving complex real-world tasks by strategically combining existing tools for maximum effectiveness, rather than reinventing them.</p></details> |  |
| **[AsymLoRA: Harmonizing Data Conflicts and Commonalities in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20035v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective instruction fine-tuning on diverse image-text datasets is crucial for developing a versatile Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), where dataset composition dictates the model's adaptability across multimodal tasks. However, complex datasets often contain inherent conflicts -- stemming from modality-specific optimization objectives -- and latent commonalities that enable cross-task transfer, which most existing approaches handle separately. To bridge this gap, we introduce AsymLoRA, a parameter-efficient tuning framework that unifies knowledge modularization and cross-modal coordination via asymmetric LoRA: task-specific low-rank projections (matrix B) that preserve distinct adaptation pathways for conflicting objectives, and a shared projection (matrix A) that consolidates cross-modal commonalities. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AsymLoRA consistently surpasses both vanilla LoRA, which captures only commonalities, and LoRA-MoE, which focuses solely on conflicts, achieving superior model performance and system efficiency across diverse benchmarks.\href{Code}{https://github.com/Clin0212/HydraLoRA/blob/main/MLLM-HydraLoRA/README.md}.</p></details> |  |

However, while MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the transferability of these attacks across different models remains limited, especially under targeted attack setting. Existing methods primarily focus on vision-specific perturbations but struggle with the complex nature of vision-language modality alignment. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Vision-Language Alignment (DynVLA) Attack, a novel approach that injects dynamic perturbations into the vision-language connector to enhance generalization across diverse vision-language alignment of different models. Our experimental results show that DynVLA significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples across various MLLMs, including BLIP2, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT4, LLaVA, and closed-source models such as Gemini.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.09766</p></details> |

M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

We also present MM-AlignBench, a human-annotated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' alignment with human values. Experimental results show that finetuning MLLMs with OmniAlign-V, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), significantly enhances human preference alignment while maintaining or enhancing performance on standard VQA benchmarks, preserving their fundamental capabilities.

Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

However, recent works show that LLMs still suffer from hallucinations in NLI due to attestation bias, where LLMs overly rely on propositional memory to build shortcuts. To solve the issue, we design an unsupervised framework to construct counterfactual reasoning data and fine-tune LLMs to reduce attestation bias. To measure bias reduction, we build bias-adversarial variants of NLI datasets with randomly replaced predicates in premises while keeping hypotheses unchanged. Extensive evaluations show that our framework can significantly reduce hallucinations from attestation bias. Then, we further evaluate LLMs fine-tuned with our framework on original NLI datasets and their bias-neutralized versions, where original entities are replaced with randomly sampled ones. Extensive results show that our framework consistently improves inferential performance on both original and bias-neutralized NLI datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Implicit Bias-Like Patterns in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit bias refers to automatic or spontaneous mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research examining `implicit bias' in large language models (LLMs) has often approached the phenomenon differently than how it is studied in humans by focusing primarily on model outputs rather than on model processing. To examine model processing, we present a method called the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) for studying implicit bias-like patterns in reasoning models: LLMs that employ step-by-step reasoning to solve complex tasks. Using this method, we find that reasoning models require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information compared to association-compatible information. These findings suggest AI systems harbor patterns in processing information that are analogous to human implicit bias. We consider the implications of these implicit bias-like patterns for their deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[VERIFY: A Benchmark of Visual Explanation and Reasoning for Investigating Multimodal Reasoning Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11557v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning is central to human cognition, enabling individuals to interpret and abstractly understand their environment. Although recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks primarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual reasoning capabilities. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a benchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. VERIFY compels models to reason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to reduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases. Each problem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first to provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes. Additionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity beyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model reasoning patterns. Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers significant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic approach to both perception and reasoning.

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

To investigate this topic, we present \textsf{RESPONSE}, a human-curated dataset containing 1789 annotated instances featuring 6037 sets of questions designed to assess LLMs' commonsense reasoning in disaster situations across different time frames. The dataset includes problem descriptions, missing resources, time-sensitive solutions, and their justifications, with a subset validated by environmental engineers. Through both automatic metrics and human evaluation, we compare LLM-generated recommendations against human responses. Our findings show that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 achieve only 37\% human-evaluated correctness for immediate response actions, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLMs' ability for commonsense reasoning in crises.</p></details> |  |

Previous research on road rage regulation has primarily focused on response suppression, lacking proactive prevention capabilities. With the advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it has become possible to reason about trigger events visually and then engage in dialog-based comforting before drivers' anger escalates. To this end, we propose the road rage reasoning task, along with a finely annotated test dataset and evaluation metrics, to assess the capabilities of current mainstream VLMs in scene understanding, event recognition, and road rage reasoning. The results indicate that current VLMs exhibit significant shortcomings in scene understanding within the visual modality, as well as in comprehending the spatial relationships between objects in the textual modality. Improving VLMs' performance in these areas will greatly benefit downstream tasks like antecedent-focused road rage regulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking General Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models via Representation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11314v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in long chain-of-thoughts(long CoTs) have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models(LLMs). Existing work finds that the capability of long CoT reasoning can be efficiently elicited by tuning on only a few examples and can easily transfer to other tasks. This motivates us to investigate whether long CoT reasoning is a general capability for LLMs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis for this question from the perspective of representation. We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning. Inspired by these findings, we propose GLoRE, a novel representation engineering method to unleash the general long CoT reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GLoRE in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Grounded Natural Language Explanations for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11248v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a large language model explainability technique for obtaining faithful natural language explanations by grounding the explanations in a reasoning process. When converted to a sequence of tokens, the outputs of the reasoning process can become part of the model context and later be decoded to natural language as the model produces either the final answer or the explanation. To improve the faithfulness of the explanations, we propose to use a joint predict-explain approach, in which the answers and explanations are inferred directly from the reasoning sequence, without the explanations being dependent on the answers and vice versa. We demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed technique by achieving a high alignment between answers and explanations in several problem domains, observing that language models often simply copy the partial decisions from the reasoning sequence into the final answers or explanations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed use of reasoning can also improve the quality of the answers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Reasoning Models do Analogical Reasoning under Perceptual Uncertainty?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11207v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a first evaluation of two state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek R1, on analogical reasoning, focusing on well-established nonverbal human IQ tests based on Raven's progressive matrices. We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its more difficult extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these nonverbal analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles and 2) smoothen the distributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% -- approaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these out-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

| **[Don't Take Things Out of Context: Attention Intervention for Enhancing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11154v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), functioning as a whole to guide these models in generating reasoning steps toward final answers. However, we observe that isolated segments, words, or tokens within CoT demonstrations can unexpectedly disrupt the generation process of LLMs. The model may overly concentrate on certain local information present in the demonstration, introducing irrelevant noise into the reasoning process and potentially leading to incorrect answers. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanism of CoT through dynamically tracing and manipulating the inner workings of LLMs at each output step, which demonstrates that tokens exhibiting specific attention characteristics are more likely to induce the model to take things out of context; these tokens directly attend to the hidden states tied with prediction, without substantial integration of non-local information. Building upon these insights, we propose a Few-shot Attention Intervention method (FAI) that dynamically analyzes the attention patterns of demonstrations to accurately identify these tokens and subsequently make targeted adjustments to the attention weights to effectively suppress their distracting effect on LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, with a remarkable 5.91% improvement on the AQuA dataset, further highlighting the effectiveness of FAI.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

In this work, we propose a novel benchmark, Open3DVQA, to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capacities of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models in open 3D space. Open3DVQA consists of 9k VQA samples, collected using an efficient semi-automated tool in a high-fidelity urban simulator. We evaluate several SOTA MLLMs across various aspects of spatial reasoning, such as relative and absolute spatial relationships, situational reasoning, and object-centric spatial attributes. Our results reveal that: 1) MLLMs perform better at answering questions regarding relative spatial relationships than absolute spatial relationships, 2) MLLMs demonstrate similar spatial reasoning abilities for both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and 3) Fine-tuning large models significantly improves their performance across different spatial reasoning tasks. We believe that our open-source data collection tools and in-depth analyses will inspire further research on MLLM spatial reasoning capabilities. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/WeichenZh/Open3DVQA.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we propose EmbodiedVSR (Embodied Visual Spatial Reasoning), a novel framework that integrates dynamic scene graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance spatial understanding for embodied agents. By explicitly constructing structured knowledge representations through dynamic scene graphs, our method enables zero-shot spatial reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning. This approach not only disentangles intricate spatial relationships but also aligns reasoning steps with actionable environmental dynamics. To rigorously evaluate performance, we introduce the eSpatial-Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset including real-world embodied scenarios with fine-grained spatial annotations and adaptive task difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in accuracy and reasoning coherence, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring iterative environment interaction. The results reveal the untapped potential of MLLMs for embodied intelligence when equipped with structured, explainable reasoning mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable deployment in real-world spatial applications. The codes and datasets will be released soon.</p></details> | technical report |

Yet, this progress disrupts traditional agent frameworks, traditionally anchored by execution-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). To explore this transformation, we propose the LaRMA framework, encompassing nine tasks across Tool Usage, Plan Design, and Problem Solving, assessed with three top LLMs (e.g., Claude3.5-sonnet) and five leading LRMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Our findings address four research questions: LRMs surpass LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks like Plan Design, leveraging iterative reflection for superior outcomes; LLMs excel in execution-driven tasks such as Tool Usage, prioritizing efficiency; hybrid LLM-LRM configurations, pairing LLMs as actors with LRMs as reflectors, optimize agent performance by blending execution speed with reasoning depth; and LRMs' enhanced reasoning incurs higher computational costs, prolonged processing, and behavioral challenges, including overthinking and fact-ignoring tendencies. This study fosters deeper inquiry into LRMs' balance of deep thinking and overthinking, laying a critical foundation for future agent design advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>71 pa...</summary><p>71 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We introduce TxAgent, an AI agent that leverages multi-step reasoning and real-time biomedical knowledge retrieval across a toolbox of 211 tools to analyze drug interactions, contraindications, and patient-specific treatment strategies. TxAgent evaluates how drugs interact at molecular, pharmacokinetic, and clinical levels, identifies contraindications based on patient comorbidities and concurrent medications, and tailors treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. It retrieves and synthesizes evidence from multiple biomedical sources, assesses interactions between drugs and patient conditions, and refines treatment recommendations through iterative reasoning. It selects tools based on task objectives and executes structured function calls to solve therapeutic tasks that require clinical reasoning and cross-source validation. The ToolUniverse consolidates 211 tools from trusted sources, including all US FDA-approved drugs since 1939 and validated clinical insights from Open Targets. TxAgent outperforms leading LLMs, tool-use models, and reasoning agents across five new benchmarks: DrugPC, BrandPC, GenericPC, TreatmentPC, and DescriptionPC, covering 3,168 drug reasoning tasks and 456 personalized treatment scenarios. It achieves 92.1% accuracy in open-ended drug reasoning tasks, surpassing GPT-4o and outperforming DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in structured multi-step reasoning. TxAgent generalizes across drug name variants and descriptions.

| **[Bialgebraic Reasoning on Stateful Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10955v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about program equivalence in imperative languages is notoriously challenging, as the presence of states (in the form of variable stores) fundamentally increases the observational power of program terms. The key desideratum for any notion of equivalence is compositionality, guaranteeing that subprograms can be safely replaced by equivalent subprograms regardless of the context. To facilitate compositionality proofs and avoid boilerplate work, one would hope to employ the abstract bialgebraic methods provided by Turi and Plotkin's powerful theory of mathematical operational semantics (a.k.a. abstract GSOS) or its recent extension by Goncharov et al. to higher-order languages. However, multiple attempts to apply abstract GSOS to stateful languages have thus failed. We propose a novel approach to the operational semantics of stateful languages based on the formal distinction between readers (terms that expect an initial input store before being executed), and writers (running terms that have already been provided with a store). In contrast to earlier work, this style of semantics is fully compatible with abstract GSOS, and we can thus leverage the existing theory to obtain coinductive reasoning techniques. We demonstrate that our approach generates non-trivial compositionality results for stateful languages with first-order and higher-order store and that it flexibly applies to program equivalences at different levels of granularity, such as trace, cost, and natural equivalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taxonomic Reasoning for Rare Arthropods: Combining Dense Image Captioning and RAG for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

The practical applications often involve analyzing time-series data alongside contextual information in the form of natural language to support informed decisions. However, current time-series models are limited in their ability to perform reasoning that involves both time-series and their textual content. In this work, we address this gap by introducing \textit{Chat-TS}, a large language model (LLM) based framework, designed to support reasoning over time series and textual data. Unlike traditional models, Chat-TS integrates time-series tokens into LLMs' vocabulary, enhancing its reasoning ability over both modalities without compromising the core natural language capabilities, enabling practical analysis and reasoning across modalities. To support learning and evaluation in this setup, we contribute new datasets: the \textit{TS Instruct Training Dataset} which pairs diverse time-series data with relevant text instructions and responses for instruction tuning, the \textit{TS Instruct Question and Answer (QA) Gold Dataset} which provides multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning, and a \textit{TS Instruct Quantitative Probing Set} which contains a small subset of the TS Instruct QA tasks alongside math and decision-making questions for LLM evaluation. We designed a training strategy to preserve the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs while augmenting them for time-series reasoning. Experiments show that Chat-TS achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal reasoning tasks by maintaining strong natural language proficiency while improving time-series reasoning. ~\footnote{To ensure replicability and facilitate future research, all models, datasets, and code will be available at [\texttt{Github-URL}].}</p></details> |  |

Their language capabilities have positioned them at the forefront of the future AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) race. However, on closer inspection, Valmeekam et al. (2024); Zecevic et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2024) highlight a significant gap between their language proficiency and reasoning abilities. Reasoning in LLMs and Vision Language Models (VLMs) aims to bridge this gap by enabling these models to think and re-evaluate their actions and responses. Reasoning is an essential capability for complex problem-solving and a necessary step toward establishing trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This will make AI suitable for deployment in sensitive domains, such as healthcare, banking, law, defense, security etc. In recent times, with the advent of powerful reasoning models like OpenAI O1 and DeepSeek R1, reasoning endowment has become a critical research topic in LLMs. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview and comparison of existing reasoning techniques and present a systematic survey of reasoning-imbued language models. We also study current challenges and present our findings.</p></details> |  |

We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent.

In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

| **[Statistical Impossibility and Possibility of Aligning LLMs with Human Preferences: From Condorcet Paradox to Nash Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10990v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences is critical for ensuring fairness and informed outcomes when deploying these models for decision-making. In this paper, we seek to uncover fundamental statistical limits concerning aligning LLMs with human preferences, with a focus on the probabilistic representation of human preferences and the preservation of diverse preferences in aligned LLMs. We first show that human preferences can be represented by a reward model if and only if the preference among LLM-generated responses is free of any Condorcet cycle. Moreover, we prove that Condorcet cycles exist with probability converging to one exponentially fast under a probabilistic preference model, thereby demonstrating the impossibility of fully aligning human preferences using reward-based approaches such as reinforcement learning from human feedback. Next, we explore the conditions under which LLMs would employ mixed strategies -- meaning they do not collapse to a single response -- when aligned in the limit using a non-reward-based approach, such as Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for mixed strategies: the absence of a response that is preferred over all others by a majority. As a blessing, we prove that this condition holds with high probability under the probabilistic preference model, thereby highlighting the statistical possibility of preserving minority preferences without explicit regularization in aligning LLMs. Finally, we leverage insights from our statistical results to design a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for finding Nash equilibria in aligning LLMs with NLHF. Our experiments show that Llama-3.2-1B, aligned with our algorithm, achieves a win rate of 60.55\% against the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Auditing language models for hidden objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10965v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the feasibility of conducting alignment audits: investigations into whether models have undesired objectives. As a testbed, we train a language model with a hidden objective. Our training pipeline first teaches the model about exploitable errors in RLHF reward models (RMs), then trains the model to exploit some of these errors. We verify via out-of-distribution evaluations that the model generalizes to exhibit whatever behaviors it believes RMs rate highly, including ones not reinforced during training. We leverage this model to study alignment audits in two ways. First, we conduct a blind auditing game where four teams, unaware of the model's hidden objective or training, investigate it for concerning behaviors and their causes. Three teams successfully uncovered the model's hidden objective using techniques including interpretability with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), behavioral attacks, and training data analysis. Second, we conduct an unblinded follow-up study of eight techniques for auditing the model, analyzing their strengths and limitations. Overall, our work provides a concrete example of using alignment audits to discover a model's hidden objective and proposes a methodology for practicing and validating progress in alignment auditing.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our model improves the reasoning performance of three types of MLLMs and four different model scales. Even when applied to the highly capable InternVL2.5-78B, it achieves a 5.9-point improvement across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that our model exhibits superior performance compared to Outcome Reward Models and Self-Consistency during BoN evaluation. To facilitate the training of multimodal PRMs, we construct a multimodal process supervision dataset VisualPRM400K using an automated data pipeline. For the evaluation of multimodal PRMs, we propose VisualProcessBench, a benchmark with human-annotated step-wise correctness labels, to measure the abilities of PRMs to detect erroneous steps in multimodal reasoning tasks. We hope that our work can inspire more future research and contribute to the development of MLLMs. Our model, data, and benchmark are released in https://internvl.github.io/blog/2025-03-13-VisualPRM/.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, we consider the problem of teaching/enforcing a target policy $\pi^\dagger$ by synthesizing preference data. We seek to understand the susceptibility of different preference-based learning paradigms to poisoned preference data by analyzing the number of samples required by the attacker to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. We first propose a general data poisoning formulation in learning from human preferences and then study it for two popular paradigms, namely: (a) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that operates by learning a reward model using preferences; (b) direct preference optimization (DPO) that directly optimizes policy using preferences. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of data poisoning in a setting where the attacker is allowed to augment a pre-existing dataset and also study its special case where the attacker can synthesize the entire preference dataset from scratch. As our main results, we provide lower/upper bounds on the number of samples required to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of the susceptibility of these learning paradigms under such data poisoning attacks.</p></details> | In AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Representation-based Reward Modeling for Efficient Safety Alignment of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10093v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), encounter the challenge of distribution shift. Current approaches typically address this issue through online sampling from the target policy, which requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we hypothesize that during off-policy training, while the ranking order of output generated by policy changes, their overall distribution remains relatively stable. This stability allows the transformation of the sampling process from the target policy into a re-ranking of preference data. Building on this hypothesis, We propose a new framework that leverages the model's intrinsic safety judgment capability to extract reward signals, which are then used to calculate label confidence for preferences reordering. Extensive experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift issue, remarkably enhancing the safety performance while reducing about 300x computational overheads.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), rely on centralized data collection, making them computationally expensive and privacy-invasive. We introduce PluralLLM a federated learning-based approach that enables multiple user groups to collaboratively train a transformer-based preference predictor without sharing sensitive data, which can also serve as a reward model for aligning LLMs. Our method leverages Federated Averaging (FedAvg) to aggregate preference updates efficiently, achieving 46% faster convergence, a 4% improvement in alignment scores, and nearly the same group fairness measure as in centralized training. Evaluated on a Q/A preference alignment task, PluralLLM demonstrates that federated preference learning offers a scalable and privacy-preserving alternative for aligning LLMs with diverse human values.</p></details> |  |
| **[RewardSDS: Aligning Score Distillation via Reward-Weighted Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09601v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective technique for leveraging 2D diffusion priors for tasks such as text-to-3D generation. While powerful, SDS struggles with achieving fine-grained alignment to user intent. To overcome this, we introduce RewardSDS, a novel approach that weights noise samples based on alignment scores from a reward model, producing a weighted SDS loss. This loss prioritizes gradients from noise samples that yield aligned high-reward output. Our approach is broadly applicable and can extend SDS-based methods. In particular, we demonstrate its applicability to Variational Score Distillation (VSD) by introducing RewardVSD. We evaluate RewardSDS and RewardVSD on text-to-image, 2D editing, and text-to-3D generation tasks, showing significant improvements over SDS and VSD on a diverse set of metrics measuring generation quality and alignment to desired reward models, enabling state-of-the-art performance.

| **[PISA Experiments: Exploring Physics Post-Training for Video Diffusion Models by Watching Stuff Drop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09595v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained video generation models excel in content creation but are not reliable as physically accurate world simulators out of the box. This work studies the process of post-training these models for accurate world modeling through the lens of the simple, yet fundamental, physics task of modeling object freefall. We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling. Additionally, we release a benchmark for this task that may serve as a useful diagnostic tool for tracking physical accuracy in large-scale video generative model development.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3PO: Preference-Based Alignment of Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08295v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains, with recent advancements extending their applicability to discrete data. However, aligning discrete diffusion models with task-specific preferences remains challenging, particularly in scenarios where explicit reward functions are unavailable. In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion DPO (D3PO), the first adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to discrete diffusion models formulated as continuous-time Markov chains. Our approach derives a novel loss function that directly fine-tunes the generative process using preference data while preserving fidelity to a reference distribution. We validate D3PO on a structured binary sequence generation task, demonstrating that the method effectively aligns model outputs with preferences while maintaining structural validity. Our results highlight that D3PO enables controlled fine-tuning without requiring explicit reward models, making it a practical alternative to reinforcement learning-based approaches. Future research will explore extending D3PO to more complex generative tasks, including language modeling and protein sequence generation, as well as investigating alternative noise schedules, such as uniform noising, to enhance flexibility across different applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Although many approaches have attempted to address this issue by fine-tuning models using various reward models, etc., we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages both positive and negative pairs. To achieve this efficiently even with pretrained models, we introduce a lightweight contrastive fine tuning strategy called SoftREPA that uses soft text tokens. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Large Language Models that Benefit for All: Benchmarking Group Fairness in Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07806v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful and accessible to human users, ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups, i.e., group fairness, is a critical ethical concern. However, current fairness and bias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional group fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the non-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same across different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups, however, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes impractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final output without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in LLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For finetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned reward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the LLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias. Recognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of learned reward models. By using expert-written text from arXiv, we are able to benchmark the group fairness of reward models without requiring the same prompt questions across different demographic groups. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that all the evaluated reward models (e.g., Nemotron-4-340B-Reward, ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1, and GRM-llama3-8B-sftreg) exhibit statistically significant group unfairness. We also observed that top-performing reward models (w.r.t. canonical performance metrics) tend to demonstrate better group fairness.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing RL-based methods suffer from low sample efficiency due to sparse rewards and underused solutions. We propose Preference Optimization for Combinatorial Optimization (POCO), a training paradigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It introduces: (1) an efficient preference pair construction for better explore and exploit solutions, and (2) a novel loss function that adaptively scales gradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or reference policies. Experiments on Job-Shop Scheduling (JSP), Traveling Salesman (TSP), and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (FJSP) show POCO outperforms state-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with efficient inference. POCO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization as a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, reward models (RMs) have become increasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs evaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning results, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning process, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for vision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their capabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the all-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the visual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions. VLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering mathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image understanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on evaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and critique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed by VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary classification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy. Additionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable insights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will serve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Mitigating Preference Hacking in Policy Optimization with Pessimism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06810v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work tackles the problem of overoptimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a prevalent technique for aligning models with human preferences. RLHF relies on reward or preference models trained on \emph{fixed preference datasets}, and these models are unreliable when evaluated outside the support of this preference data, leading to the common reward or preference hacking phenomenon. We propose novel, pessimistic objectives for RLHF which are provably robust to overoptimization through the use of pessimism in the face of uncertainty, and design practical algorithms, P3O and PRPO, to optimize these objectives. Our approach is derived for the general preference optimization setting, but can be used with reward models as well. We evaluate P3O and PRPO on the tasks of fine-tuning language models for document summarization and creating helpful assistants, demonstrating remarkable resilience to overoptimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dr Genre: Reinforcement Learning from Decoupled LLM Feedback for Generic Text Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06781v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generic text rewriting is a prevalent large language model (LLM) application that covers diverse real-world tasks, such as style transfer, fact correction, and email editing. These tasks vary in rewriting objectives (e.g., factual consistency vs. semantic preservation), making it challenging to develop a unified model that excels across all dimensions. Existing methods often specialize in either a single task or a specific objective, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we introduce a generic model proficient in factuality, stylistic, and conversational rewriting tasks. To simulate real-world user rewrite requests, we construct a conversational rewrite dataset, ChatRewrite, that presents ``natural''-sounding instructions, from raw emails using LLMs. Combined with other popular rewrite datasets, including LongFact for the factuality rewrite task and RewriteLM for the stylistic rewrite task, this forms a broad benchmark for training and evaluating generic rewrite models. To align with task-specific objectives, we propose Dr Genre, a Decoupled-reward learning framework for Generic rewriting, that utilizes objective-oriented reward models with a task-specific weighting. Evaluation shows that \approach delivers higher-quality rewrites across all targeted tasks, improving objectives including instruction following (agreement), internal consistency (coherence), and minimal unnecessary edits (conciseness).</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 4 figures, 25 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Captions to Rewards (CAREVL): Leveraging Large Language Model Experts for Enhanced Reward Modeling in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06260v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large vision-language models (LVLMs) with human preferences is challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained, high-quality, and multimodal preference data without human annotations. Existing methods relying on direct distillation often struggle with low-confidence data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose CAREVL, a novel method for preference reward modeling by reliably using both high- and low-confidence data. First, a cluster of auxiliary expert models (textual reward models) innovatively leverages image captions as weak supervision signals to filter high-confidence data. The high-confidence data are then used to fine-tune the LVLM. Second, low-confidence data are used to generate diverse preference samples using the fine-tuned LVLM. These samples are then scored and selected to construct reliable chosen-rejected pairs for further training. CAREVL achieves performance improvements over traditional distillation-based methods on VL-RewardBench and MLLM-as-a-Judge benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Reward Model for Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05236v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in human preference alignment have significantly enhanced multimodal generation and understanding. A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/</p></details> |
| **[Rewarding Curse: Analyze and Mitigate Reward Modeling Issues for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05188v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.</p></details> | 18 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Empirical Bound Information-Directed Sampling for Norm-Agnostic Bandits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05098v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information-directed sampling (IDS) is a powerful framework for solving bandit problems which has shown strong results in both Bayesian and frequentist settings. However, frequentist IDS, like many other bandit algorithms, requires that one have prior knowledge of a (relatively) tight upper bound on the norm of the true parameter vector governing the reward model in order to achieve good performance. Unfortunately, this requirement is rarely satisfied in practice. As we demonstrate, using a poorly calibrated bound can lead to significant regret accumulation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel frequentist IDS algorithm that iteratively refines a high-probability upper bound on the true parameter norm using accumulating data. We focus on the linear bandit setting with heteroskedastic subgaussian noise. Our method leverages a mixture of relevant information gain criteria to balance exploration aimed at tightening the estimated parameter norm bound and directly searching for the optimal action. We establish regret bounds for our algorithm that do not depend on an initially assumed parameter norm bound and demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art IDS and UCB algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Cross-Lingual Rewarding for Efficient Multilingual Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04647v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a prominent method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO has enabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference alignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that $\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English models by implicit rewards and $\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages through iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model from the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference model. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in cross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to evaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for multilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from English to other languages. Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a 12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control Win Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable efficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly reducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.
