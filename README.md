| **[ThinkOmni: Lifting Textual Reasoning to Omni-modal Scenarios via Guidance Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23306v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal reasoning is essential for intelligent systems to understand and draw inferences from diverse data sources. While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | Accept by ICLR 2026 |
| **[OmniGAIA: Towards Native Omni-Modal AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22897v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmoOmni: Bridging Emotional Understanding and Expression in Omni-Modal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21900v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Omni-Modal Large Language Models~(Omni-LLMs) has revolutionized human--computer interaction, enabling unified audio-visual perception and speech response. However, existing Omni-LLMs struggle with complex real-world scenarios, often leading to superficial understanding and contextually mismatched emotional responses. This issue is further intensified by Omni-LLM's Thinker-Talker architectures, which are implicitly connected through hidden states, leading to the loss of emotional details. In this work, we present EmoOmni, a unified framework for accurate understanding and expression in multimodal emotional dialogue. At its core, we introduce the emotional Chain-of-Thought~(E-CoT), which enforces a reasoning from fine-grained multimodal perception to textual response. Moreover, we explicitly treat E-CoT as high-level emotional instructions that guide the talker, enabling accurate emotional expression. Complementing the model, we construct EmoOmniPipe to obtain the real-world annotated dialogue data and establish a benchmark, EmoOmniEval, to facilitate systematic assessment of multimodal emotional dialogue task. Experiments show that EmoOmni-7B achieves comparable performance with Qwen3Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking under the same talker.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Brain, Omni Modalities: Towards Unified Non-Invasive Brain Decoding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21522v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deciphering brain function through non-invasive recordings requires synthesizing complementary high-frequency electromagnetic (EEG/MEG) and low-frequency metabolic (fMRI) signals. However, despite their shared neural origins, extreme discrepancies have traditionally confined these modalities to isolated analysis pipelines, hindering a holistic interpretation of brain activity. To bridge this fragmentation, we introduce \textbf{NOBEL}, a \textbf{n}euro-\textbf{o}mni-modal \textbf{b}rain-\textbf{e}ncoding \textbf{l}arge language model (LLM) that unifies these heterogeneous signals within the LLM's semantic embedding space. Our architecture integrates a unified encoder for EEG and MEG with a novel dual-path strategy for fMRI, aligning non-invasive brain signals and external sensory stimuli into a shared token space, then leverages an LLM as a universal backbone. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NOBEL serves as a robust generalist across standard single-modal tasks. We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses. NOBEL thus takes a step towards unifying non-invasive brain decoding, demonstrating the promising potential of omni-modal brain understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-iEEG: A Large-Scale, Comprehensive iEEG Dataset and Benchmark for Epilepsy Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16072v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

| **[OMNI-LEAK: Orchestrator Multi-Agent Network Induced Data Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13477v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the presence of data access control. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; corrected typos</p></details> |
| **[DreamID-Omni: Unified Framework for Controllable Human-Centric Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12160v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://guoxu1233.github.io/DreamID-Omni/</p></details> |
| **[Tele-Omni: a Unified Multimodal Framework for Video Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09609v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Safety under Cross-Modality Conflict: Vulnerabilities, Dynamics Mechanisms and Efficient Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10161v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) greatly expand LLMs' multimodal capabilities but also introduce cross-modal safety risks. However, a systematic understanding of vulnerabilities in omni-modal interactions remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we establish a modality-semantics decoupling principle and construct the AdvBench-Omni dataset, which reveals a significant vulnerability in OLLMs. Mechanistic analysis uncovers a Mid-layer Dissolution phenomenon driven by refusal vector magnitude shrinkage, alongside the existence of a modal-invariant pure refusal direction. Inspired by these insights, we extract a golden refusal vector using Singular Value Decomposition and propose OmniSteer, which utilizes lightweight adapters to modulate intervention intensity adaptively. Extensive experiments show that our method not only increases the Refusal Success Rate against harmful inputs from 69.9% to 91.2%, but also effectively preserves the general capabilities across all modalities. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/omni-safety-research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Video 2: Scaling MLLM-Conditioned Diffusion for Unified Video Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08820v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Omni-Video 2, a scalable and computationally efficient model that connects pretrained multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) with video diffusion models for unified video generation and editing. Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation. The results demonstrate its superior ability to follow complex compositional instructions in video editing, while also achieving competitive or superior quality in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/Omni-Video2-project/</p></details> |
| **[Ex-Omni: Enabling 3D Facial Animation Generation for Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07106v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Physical Intelligence Emergence via Omni-Modal Architecture and Physical Data Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07064v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical understanding remains brittle in omni-modal models because key physical attributes are visually ambiguous and sparsely represented in web-scale data. We present OmniFysics, a compact omni-modal model that unifies understanding across images, audio, video, and text, with integrated speech and image generation. To inject explicit physical knowledge, we build a physical data engine with two components. FysicsAny produces physics-grounded instruction--image supervision by mapping salient objects to verified physical attributes through hierarchical retrieval over a curated prototype database, followed by physics-law--constrained verification and caption rewriting. FysicsOmniCap distills web videos via audio--visual consistency filtering to generate high-fidelity video--instruction pairs emphasizing cross-modal physical cues. We train OmniFysics with staged multimodal alignment and instruction tuning, adopt latent-space flow matching for text-to-image generation, and use an intent router to activate generation only when needed. Experiments show competitive performance on standard multimodal benchmarks and improved results on physics-oriented evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04804v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[OMNI-Dent: Towards an Accessible and Explainable AI Framework for Automated Dental Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07041v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate dental diagnosis is essential for oral healthcare, yet many individuals lack access to timely professional evaluation. Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals. These approaches also require large amounts of expert-annotated data and often struggle to generalize across diverse real-world imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardReasoner-Omni: A Reasoning-based Multi-modal Guardrail for Text, Image, and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03328v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GuardReasoner-Omni, a reasoning-based guardrail model designed to moderate text, image, and video data. First, we construct a comprehensive training corpus comprising 148k samples spanning these three modalities. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage paradigm to incentivize the model to deliberate before making decisions: (1) conducting SFT to cold-start the model with explicit reasoning capabilities and structural adherence; and (2) performing RL, incorporating an error-driven exploration reward to incentivize deeper reasoning on hard samples. We release a suite of models scaled at 2B and 4B parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GuardReasoner-Omni achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines across various guardrail benchmarks. Notably, GuardReasoner-Omni (2B) significantly surpasses the runner-up by 5.3% F1 score.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-RRM: Advancing Omni Reward Modeling via Automatic Rubric-Grounded Preference Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00846v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet their performance is often capped by the coarse nature of existing alignment techniques. A critical bottleneck remains the lack of effective reward models (RMs): existing RMs are predominantly vision-centric, return opaque scalar scores, and rely on costly human annotations. We introduce \textbf{Omni-RRM}, the first open-source rubric-grounded reward model that produces structured, multi-dimension preference judgments with dimension-wise justifications across \textbf{text, image, video, and audio}. At the core of our approach is \textbf{Omni-Preference}, a large-scale dataset built via a fully automated pipeline: we synthesize candidate response pairs by contrasting models of different capabilities, and use strong teacher models to \emph{reconcile and filter} preferences while providing a modality-aware \emph{rubric-grounded rationale} for each pair. This eliminates the need for human-labeled training preferences. Omni-RRM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning to learn the rubric-grounded outputs, followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) to sharpen discrimination on difficult, low-contrast pairs. Comprehensive evaluations show that Omni-RRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video (80.2\% on ShareGPT-V) and audio (66.8\% on Audio-HH-RLHF) benchmarks, and substantially outperforms existing open-source RMs on image tasks, with a 17.7\% absolute gain over its base model on overall accuracy. Omni-RRM also improves downstream performance via Best-of-$N$ selection and transfers to text-only preference benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Omni-RRM-CC08.</p></details> |  |

We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Alignment Curse: Cross-Modality Jailbreak Transfer in Omni-Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02557v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Long-Form Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23294v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real scenarios, videos can span several minutes or even hours. However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.</p></details> |  |
| **[ColoDiff: Integrating Dynamic Consistency With Content Awareness for Colonoscopy Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23203v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colonoscopy video generation delivers dynamic, information-rich data critical for diagnosing intestinal diseases, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Labels, No Look-Ahead: Unsupervised Online Video Stabilization with Classical Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23141v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new unsupervised framework for online video stabilization. Unlike methods based on deep learning that require paired stable and unstable datasets, our approach instantiates the classical stabilization pipeline with three stages and incorporates a multithreaded buffering mechanism. This design addresses three longstanding challenges in end-to-end learning: limited data, poor controllability, and inefficiency on hardware with constrained resources. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on handheld videos with a forward view in visible light, which restricts the applicability of stabilization to domains such as UAV nighttime remote sensing. To fill this gap, we introduce a new multimodal UAV aerial video dataset (UAV-Test). Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online stabilizers in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving performance comparable to offline methods.</p></details> | CVPR2026 |
| **[PackUV: Packed Gaussian UV Maps for 4D Volumetric Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23040v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric videos offer immersive 4D experiences, but remain difficult to reconstruct, store, and stream at scale. Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications. We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure. To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in rendering fidelity while scaling to sequences up to 30 minutes with consistent quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/packuv</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Velocity and stroke rate reconstruction of canoe sprint team boats based on panned and zoomed video recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22941v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pacing strategies, defined by velocity and stroke rate profiles, are essential for peak performance in canoe sprint. While GPS is the gold standard for analysis, its limited availability necessitates automated video-based solutions. This paper presents an extended framework for reconstructing performance metrics from panned and zoomed video recordings across all sprint disciplines (K1-K4, C1-C2) and distances (200m-500m). Our method utilizes YOLOv8 for buoy and athlete detection, leveraging the known buoy grid to estimate homographies. We generalized the estimation of the boat position by means of learning a boat-specific athlete offset using a U-net based boat tip calibration. Further, we implement a robust tracking scheme using optical flow to adapt to multi-athlete boat types. Finally, we introduce methods to extract stroke rate information from either pose estimations or the athlete bounding boxes themselves. Evaluation against GPS data from elite competitions yields a velocity RRMSE of 0.020 +- 0.011 (rho = 0.956) and a stroke rate RRMSE of 0.022 +- 0.024 (rho = 0.932). The methods provide coaches with highly accurate, automated feedback without requiring on-boat sensors or manual annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSJoE: Jointly Evolving MLLM and Sampler for Efficient Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22932v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process. Extensive experiments on VideoMME, LongVideoBench, LVBench, and MLVU show that MSJoE achieves 8.0\% accuracy gain upon the base MLLM, and 1.1\% higher accuracy than strongest baseline method.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2026 |
| **[CMSA-Net: Causal Multi-scale Aggregation with Adaptive Multi-source Reference for Video Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22821v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video polyp segmentation (VPS) is an important task in computer-aided colonoscopy, as it helps doctors accurately locate and track polyps during examinations. However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset demonstrate that CMSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and real-time clinical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajTok: Learning Trajectory Tokens enables better Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22779v1)** | 2026-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization in video models, typically through patchification, generates an excessive and redundant number of tokens. This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer. We show that it can be seamlessly integrated as either a probing head for pretrained visual features (TrajAdapter) or an alignment connector in vision-language models (TrajVLM) with especially strong performance in long-video reasoning.</p></details> | CVPR 2026 |

In this work, we present SPATIALALIGN, a self-improvement framework that enhances T2V models capabilities to depict Dynamic Spatial Relationships (DSR) specified in text prompts. We present a zeroth-order regularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune T2V models towards better alignment with DSR. Specifically, we design DSR-SCORE, a geometry-based metric that quantitatively measures the alignment between generated videos and the specified DSRs in prompts, which is a step forward from prior works that rely on VLM for evaluation. We also conduct a dataset of text-video pairs with diverse DSRs to facilitate the study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned model significantly out performs the baseline in spatial relationships. The code will be released in Link.</p></details> |  |

We propose EgoAVFlow, which learns manipulation and active vision from egocentric videos through a shared 3D flow representation that supports geometric visibility reasoning and transfers without robot demonstrations. EgoAVFlow uses diffusion models to predict robot actions, future 3D flow, and camera trajectories, and refines viewpoints at test time with reward-maximizing denoising under a visibility-aware reward computed from predicted motion and scene geometry. Real-world experiments under actively changing viewpoints show that EgoAVFlow consistently outperforms prior human-demo-based baselines, demonstrating effective visibility maintenance and robust manipulation without robot demonstrations.</p></details> |  |
| **[WHOLE: World-Grounded Hand-Object Lifted from Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22209v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric manipulation videos are highly challenging due to severe occlusions during interactions and frequent object entries and exits from the camera view as the person moves. Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction.

We introduce Solaris, a multiplayer video world model that simulates consistent multi-view observations. To enable this, we develop a multiplayer data system designed for robust, continuous, and automated data collection on video games such as Minecraft. Unlike prior platforms built for single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized videos + actions capture. Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher. Results show our architecture and training design outperform existing baselines. Through open-sourcing our system and models, we hope to lay the groundwork for a new generation of multi-agent world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://solaris-wm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Decoding the Hook: A Multimodal LLM Framework for Analyzing the Hooking Period of Video Ads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22299v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based ads are a vital medium for brands to engage consumers, with social media platforms leveraging user data to optimize ad delivery and boost engagement. A crucial but under-explored aspect is the 'hooking period', the first three seconds that capture viewer attention and influence engagement metrics. Analyzing this brief window is challenging due to the multimodal nature of video content, which blends visual, auditory, and textual elements. Traditional methods often miss the nuanced interplay of these components, requiring advanced frameworks for thorough evaluation. This study presents a framework using transformer-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze the hooking period of video ads. It tests two frame sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and key frame selection, to ensure balanced and representative acoustic feature extraction, capturing the full range of design elements. The hooking video is processed by state-of-the-art MLLMs to generate descriptive analyses of the ad's initial impact, which are distilled into coherent topics using BERTopic for high-level abstraction. The framework also integrates features such as audio attributes and aggregated ad targeting information, enriching the feature set for further analysis. Empirical validation on large-scale real-world data from social media platforms demonstrates the efficacy of our framework, revealing correlations between hooking period features and key performance metrics like conversion per investment. The results highlight the practical applicability and predictive power of the approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing video ad strategies. This study advances video ad analysis by providing a scalable methodology for understanding and enhancing the initial moments of video advertisements.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our approach combines a narrowband LED array with a coded-exposure-pixel (CEP) camera capable of high-speed, per-pixel exposure control, enabling joint encoding of scene information across space, time, and wavelength within each video frame. Unlike passive snapshot systems that divide light across multiple spectral channels simultaneously and assume no motion during a frame's exposure, Lumosaic actively synchronizes illumination and pixel-wise exposure, improving photon utilization and preserving spectral fidelity under motion. A learning-based reconstruction pipeline then recovers 31-channel hyperspectral (400-700 nm) video at 30 fps and VGA resolution, producing temporally coherent and spectrally accurate reconstructions. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that Lumosaic significantly improves reconstruction fidelity and temporal stability over existing snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems, enabling robust hyperspectral video across diverse materials and motion conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |

Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2026</p></details> |

Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026</p></details> |

Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence.</p></details> |  |

The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models. To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations.</p></details> |  |
