Existing approaches often rely on external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs, accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines, achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods. GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more truthful and verifiable outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap, we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex, consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously, we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[HaluMem: Evaluating Hallucinations in Memory Systems of Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03506v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions. Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns, with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding New-Knowledge-Induced Factual Hallucinations in LLMs: Analysis, Solution, and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02626v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations. However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge, is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Code Hallucinations in LLMs: Characterization, Mitigation Methods, Challenges, and Future Directions for Reliable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00776v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model hallucination is one of the most critical challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes code intelligence tasks. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into software engineering tasks, understanding and mitigating hallucination in code becomes essential. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of hallucination phenomena in code-oriented LLMs from four key perspectives. First, we begin by surveying 60 papers to define hallucination in the context of code and summarize its primary causes, such as data noise, exposure bias, and insufficient semantic grounding, while also tracing recent trends in literature across natural language processing (NLP) and software engineering communities. Second, we review model hallucination surveys in a broader span and summarize representative hallucination mitigation strategies, such as knowledge-enhanced generation, constrained decoding, and post-editing. Third, we review approaches targeted for code intelligence and highlight code-specific challenges that aggravate hallucination, including syntax sensitivity, strict type systems, and dependence on external libraries. Meanwhile, we analyze how emerging code intelligence tasks, e.g., program analysis, symbolic execution, and unit testing, are utilized to detect and mitigate hallucinations. Fourth, we summarize current evaluation benchmarks, ranging from static metrics to dynamic checks, e.g., compilation and execution correctness, and emphasize the need for hallucination-oriented benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00588v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucinations in Bibliographic Recommendation: Citation Frequency as a Proxy for Training Data Redundancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25378v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination Localization in Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25225v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel task, hallucination localization in video captioning, which aims to identify hallucinations in video captions at the span level (i.e. individual words or phrases). This allows for a more detailed analysis of hallucinations compared to existing sentence-level hallucination detection task. To establish a benchmark for hallucination localization, we construct HLVC-Dataset, a carefully curated dataset created by manually annotating 1,167 video-caption pairs from VideoLLM-generated captions. We further implement a VideoLLM-based baseline method and conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to benchmark current performance on hallucination localization.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs): An Application-Oriented Survey on RAG, Reasoning, and Agentic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24476v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[HACK: Hallucinations Along Certainty and Knowledge Axes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24222v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage. Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis, we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation, which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge categorization by showing a significant difference between the two hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that consider the hallucination underlying factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/HACK_Hallucinations_Along_Certainty_and_Knowledge_axes</p></details> |
| **[Challenging Multilingual LLMs: A New Taxonomy and Benchmark for Unraveling Hallucination in Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24073v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in https://huggingface.co/collections/AIDC-AI/marco-mt.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Reasoning Trap: How Enhancing LLM Reasoning Amplifies Tool Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22977v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench, a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i) no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic, appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that jointly optimize for capability and reliability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Multi-Modal Fact-Verification Framework for Reducing Hallucinations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22751v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems, they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches, and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confabulations from ACL Publications (CAP): A Dataset for Scientific Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22395v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain, where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages (English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages (Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OlaMind: Towards Human-Like and Hallucination-Safe Customer Service for Retrieval-Augmented Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22143v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency. However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Gaze Shifts for Guidance: Cross-Modal Fusion Enhancement for VLM Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22067v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores. However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding, while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterpDetect: Interpretable Signals for Detecting Hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21538v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore, classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses, demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs), consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20690v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters, compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically, causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the reliability of language models at fixed budgets.</p></details> |  |

However, the impact of negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Safety Stock dimensioning-the computation of the appropriate safety stock quantity-is one of several mechanisms to ensure supply chain resiliency, as it protects the supply chain against demand and supply uncertainties. Unfortunately, the major approaches to dimensioning safety stock heavily assume that demand is normally distributed and ignore future demand variability, limiting their applicability in manufacturing contexts where demand is non-normal, intermittent, and highly skewed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that relaxes the assumption of normality, enabling the demand distribution of each inventory item to be analytically determined using Kernel Density Estimation. Also, we extended the analysis from historical demand variability to forecasted demand variability. We evaluated the proposed approach against a normal distribution model in a near-world inventory replenishment simulation. Afterwards, we used a linear optimization model to determine the optimal safety stock configuration. The results from the simulation and linear optimization models showed that the data-driven approach outperformed traditional approaches. In particular, the data-driven approach achieved the desired service levels at lower safety stock levels than the conventional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[RxSafeBench: Identifying Medication Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Simulated Consultation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04328v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets, constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725 contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs. A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in BIBM2025</p></details> |
| **[A Proprietary Model-Based Safety Response Framework for AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03138v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios. This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications.</p></details> |  |

Yet planning safe, dynamically feasible trajectories remains difficult due to whole-body collision avoidance and the conservativeness of common geometric abstractions such as bounding boxes or ellipsoids. We present a whole-body motion planning and safety-critical control framework for aerial manipulators built on superquadrics (SQs). Using an SQ-plus-proxy representation, we model both the vehicle and obstacles with differentiable, geometry-accurate surfaces. Leveraging this representation, we introduce a maximum-clearance planner that fuses Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation to generate smooth, collision-aware trajectories. We further design a safety-critical controller that jointly enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via high-order control barrier functions. In simulation, our approach outperforms sampling-based planners in cluttered environments, producing faster, safer, and smoother trajectories and exceeding ellipsoid-based baselines in geometric fidelity. Actual experiments on a physical aerial-manipulation platform confirm feasibility and robustness, demonstrating consistent performance across simulation and hardware settings.

| **[An Analysis of Early-Stage Functional Safety Analysis Methods and Their Integration into Model-Based Systems Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02874v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As systems become increasingly complex, conducting effective safety analysis in the earlier phases of a system's lifecycle is essential to identify and mitigate risks before they escalate. To that end, this paper investigates the capabilities of key safety analysis techniques, namely: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Functional Hazard Analysis (FHA), and Functional Failure Identification and Propagation (FFIP), along with the current state of the literature in terms of their integration into Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). A two-phase approach is adopted. The first phase is focused on contrasting FMEA, FHA, and FFIP techniques, examining their procedures, along with a documentation of their relative strengths and limitations. Our analysis highlights FFIP's capability in identifying emergent system behaviors, second-order effects, and fault propagation; thus, suggesting it is better suited for the safety needs of modern interconnected systems. Second, we review the existing research on the efforts to integrate each of these methods into MBSE. We find that MBSE integration efforts primarily focus on FMEA, and integration of FHA and FFIP is nascent. Additionally, FMEA-MBSE integration efforts could be organized into four categories: model-to-model transformation, use of external customized algorithms, built-in MBSE packages, and manual use of standard MBSE diagrams. While our findings indicate a variety of MBSE integration approaches, there is no universally established framework or standard. This leaves room for an integration approach that could support the ongoing Digital Engineering transformation efforts by enabling a more synergistic lifecycle safety management methods and tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Barrier Functions for Safety and Stability of Constrained Nonlinear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01067v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing safe and stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems subject to complex safety specifications and input constraints. We introduce the Universal Barrier Function (UBF), a single continuously differentiable scalar-valued function that encodes both stability and safety criteria while accounting for input constraints. Using the UBF, we formulate a Quadratic Program (UBF-QP) to generate control inputs that are both safe and stabilizing under input constraints. We demonstrate that the UBF-QP is feasible if a UBF exists. Furthermore, under mild conditions, we prove that a UBF always exists. The proposed framework is then extended to systems with higher relative degrees. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Friend or Foe: How LLMs' Safety Mind Gets Fooled by Intent Shift Attack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00556v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks despite their impressive capabilities. Investigating these weaknesses is crucial for robust safety mechanisms. Existing attacks primarily distract LLMs by introducing additional context or adversarial tokens, leaving the core harmful intent unchanged. In this paper, we introduce ISA (Intent Shift Attack), which obfuscates LLMs about the intent of the attacks. More specifically, we establish a taxonomy of intent transformations and leverage them to generate attacks that may be misperceived by LLMs as benign requests for information. Unlike prior methods relying on complex tokens or lengthy context, our approach only needs minimal edits to the original request, and yields natural, human-readable, and seemingly harmless prompts. Extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial LLMs show that ISA achieves over 70% improvement in attack success rate compared to direct harmful prompts. More critically, fine-tuning models on only benign data reformulated with ISA templates elevates success rates to nearly 100%. For defense, we evaluate existing methods and demonstrate their inadequacy against ISA, while exploring both training-free and training-based mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in intent inference for LLMs safety and underscore the need for more effective defenses.

| **[Reimagining Safety Alignment with An Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00509v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications but face dual challenges: generating harmful content under jailbreak attacks and over-refusal of benign queries due to rigid safety mechanisms. These issues are further complicated by the need to accommodate different value systems and precisely align with given safety preferences. Moreover, traditional methods like SFT and RLHF lack this capability due to their costly parameter tuning requirements and inability to support multiple value systems within a single model. These problems are more obvious in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in terms of heightened over-refusal in cross-modal tasks and new security risks arising from expanded attack surfaces. We propose Magic Image, an optimization-driven visual prompt framework that enhances security while reducing over-refusal. By optimizing image prompts using harmful/benign samples, our method enables a single model to adapt to different value systems and better align with given safety preferences without parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate improved safety-effectiveness balance across diverse datasets while preserving model performance, offering a practical solution for deployable MLLM safety alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficiency vs. Alignment: Investigating Safety and Fairness Risks in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00382v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Organizations are increasingly adopting and adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted on public repositories such as HuggingFace. Although these adaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent evidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness. Since different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these critical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their trade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA, IA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model families (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235 fine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and nine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based approaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least disruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In contrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce safety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and increased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type: LLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest safety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation layer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not necessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single configuration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an inherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical guideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base model, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both safety and fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepV: Safety-Separable Latent Spaces for Scalable Neurosymbolic Plan Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26935v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass. Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space. This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

| **[The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Margins of Inverse Optimal ISSf Controllers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26397v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the gain margin of a general nonlinear system under an inverse optimal input-to-state safe (ISSf) controller of the form u=u0(x)+u*(x,u0), where u0 is the nominal control and u* is the inverse optimal safety filter that minimally modifies the nominal controller's unsafe actions over the infinite horizon. By first establishing a converse ISSf-BF theorem, we reveal the equivalence among the achievability of ISSf by feedback, the achievability of inverse optimality, and the solvability of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation associated with the inverse optimal ISSf gain assignment. Then we develop a collection of safety margin results on the overall control u=u0+u*. In the absence of disturbances, we find that standard inverse optimal safe controllers have a certain degree of gain margin. Specifically, when f(x) acts safely but u0 acts unsafely, the gain can be decreased by up to half; and when f(x) acts unsafely, we establish that, if u0 acts safely, the gain can be increased arbitrarily, whereas if u0 acts unsafely, the control recovers the full gain margin [1/2,inf). It is shown, however, that under control gain variation, the safe set of these controllers is locally asymptotically stable, which implies that their safety is sensitive to large but bounded disturbances. To make inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variation, we propose a gain margin improvement approach at the expense of an increased control effort. This improvement allows the inverse optimal safe control to inherit the standard gain margin of [1/2,inf) without requiring prior knowledge of whether f(x) or u0 acts safely on the safety boundary, while simultaneously ensuring global asymptotic stability of the resulting safe set. In the presence of disturbances, this improvement idea renders inverse optimal ISSf controllers robust to gain variations with the same gain margin of [1/2,inf).</p></details> |  |
| **[ALMGuard: Safety Shortcuts and Where to Find Them as Guardrails for Audio-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26096v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding capabilities. However, the introduction of the audio modality also brings new and unique vulnerability vectors. Previous studies have proposed jailbreak attacks that specifically target ALMs, revealing that defenses directly transferred from traditional audio adversarial attacks or text-based Large Language Model (LLM) jailbreaks are largely ineffective against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard, the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model's utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM), which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WeifeiJin/ALMGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25913v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation -- specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set. We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how \textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smooth path planning with safety margins using Piece-Wise Bezier curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24972v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient quadratic programming (QP) approach for generating smooth, $C^1$ continuous paths for mobile robots using piece-wise quadratic Bezier (PWB) curves. Our method explicitly incorporates safety margins within a structured optimization framework, balancing trajectory smoothness and robustness with manageable numerical complexity suitable for real-time and embedded applications. Comparative simulations demonstrate clear advantages over traditional piece-wise linear (PWL) path planning methods, showing reduced trajectory deviations, enhanced robustness, and improved overall path quality. These benefits are validated through simulations using a Pure-Pursuit controller in representative scenarios, highlighting the practical effectiveness and scalability of our approach for safe navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Framework with Soft Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24933v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional reachability methods provide formal guarantees of safety under bounded disturbances. However, they strictly enforce state constraints as inviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in complex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such as bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed envelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are inherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined safety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands, albeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This paper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of safety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints. Specifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred to as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed to reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring that cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified budget. The framework comprises two principal components: (i) an augmented-state model with an auxiliary budget state that tracks soft-constraint violations, and (ii) a regularization-based approximation of the discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi value function associated with the reach-avoid differential game studied herein. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical examples involving the landing of a simple point-mass model and a fixed-wing aircraft executing an emergency descent, both under wind disturbances. The simulation results validate the framework's ability to simultaneously manage both hard and soft constraints in safety-critical settings</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeEditor: Unified MLLM for Efficient Post-hoc T2I Safety Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24820v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable safety-utility balance.</p></details> |  |
| **[OS-Sentinel: Towards Safety-Enhanced Mobile GUI Agents via Hybrid Validation in Realistic Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24411v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.</p></details> | work in progress |
