Dynamics, curricula and hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21676v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models accumulate vast knowledge during pre-training, yet the dynamics governing this acquisition remain poorly understood. This work investigates the learning dynamics of language models on a synthetic factual recall task, uncovering three key findings: First, language models learn in three phases, exhibiting a performance plateau before acquiring precise factual knowledge. Mechanistically, this plateau coincides with the formation of attention-based circuits that support recall. Second, the training data distribution significantly impacts learning dynamics, as imbalanced distributions lead to shorter plateaus. Finally, hallucinations emerge simultaneously with knowledge, and integrating new knowledge into the model through fine-tuning is challenging, as it quickly corrupts its existing parametric memories. Our results emphasize the importance of data distribution in knowledge acquisition and suggest novel data scheduling strategies to accelerate neural network training.</p></details> |  |

Methods included in our study include: LLM-as-a-Judge, Prometheus, Lynx, the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), and the Trustworthy Language Model (TLM). These approaches are all reference-free, requiring no ground-truth answers/labels to catch incorrect LLM responses. Our study reveals that, across diverse RAG applications, some of these approaches consistently detect incorrect RAG responses with high precision/recall.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Alleviating LLM-based Generative Retrieval Hallucination in Alipay Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21098v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Mitigating Low-Level Visual Hallucinations Requires Self-Awareness: Database, Model and Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20673v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework. However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy for Hallucination Detection in Medical Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20504v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). Yet, they remain prone to hallucinations-incorrect responses that contradict input images, posing substantial risks in clinical decision-making. Detecting these hallucinations is essential for establishing trust in MLLMs among clinicians and patients, thereby enabling their real-world adoption. Current hallucination detection methods, especially semantic entropy (SE), have demonstrated promising hallucination detection capacity for LLMs. However, adapting SE to medical MLLMs by incorporating visual perturbations presents a dilemma. Weak perturbations preserve image content and ensure clinical validity, but may be overlooked by medical MLLMs, which tend to over rely on language priors. In contrast, strong perturbations can distort essential diagnostic features, compromising clinical interpretation. To address this issue, we propose Vision Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE), which incorporates weak image transformations and amplifies the impact of visual input, to improve hallucination detection in medical VQA. We first estimate the semantic predictive distribution under weak visual transformations to preserve clinical validity, and then amplify visual influence by contrasting this distribution with that derived from a distorted image. The entropy of the resulting distribution is estimated as VASE. Experiments on two medical open-ended VQA datasets demonstrate that VASE consistently outperforms existing hallucination detection methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Guarding against artificial intelligence--hallucinated citations: the case for full-text reference deposit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19848v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tendency of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems to "hallucinate" false information is well-known; AI-generated citations to non-existent sources have made their way into the reference lists of peer-reviewed publications. Here, I propose a solution to this problem, taking inspiration from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) data sharing guidelines, the clash of generative AI with the American judiciary, and the precedent set by submissions of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Journals should require authors to submit the full text of each cited source along with their manuscripts, thereby preventing authors from citing any material whose full text they cannot produce. This solution requires limited additional work on the part of authors or editors while effectively immunizing journals against hallucinated references.</p></details> | 3 pages |
| **[HausaNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Towards a Fine-Grained Model-Aware Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19650v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents our findings of the Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, MU-SHROOM, which focuses on identifying hallucinations and related overgeneration errors in large language models (LLMs). The shared task involves detecting specific text spans that constitute hallucinations in the outputs generated by LLMs in 14 languages. To address this task, we aim to provide a nuanced, model-aware understanding of hallucination occurrences and severity in English. We used natural language inference and fine-tuned a ModernBERT model using a synthetic dataset of 400 samples, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.032 and a correlation score of 0.422. These results indicate a moderately positive correlation between the model's confidence scores and the actual presence of hallucinations. The IoU score indicates that our model has a relatively low overlap between the predicted hallucination span and the truth annotation. The performance is unsurprising, given the intricate nature of hallucination detection. Hallucinations often manifest subtly, relying on context, making pinpointing their exact boundaries formidable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Hallucination of Large Multimodal Models in Video Understanding: Benchmark, Analysis and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19622v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hallucination of large multimodal models (LMMs), providing responses that appear correct but are actually incorrect, limits their reliability and applicability. This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%. The code and data are public at https://github.com/Hongcheng-Gao/HAVEN.</p></details> |  |
| **[KSHSeek: Data-Driven Approaches to Mitigating and Detecting Knowledge-Shortcut Hallucinations in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19482v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the development of natural language processing (NLP), especially in text generation tasks like question answering. However, model hallucinations remain a major challenge in natural language generation (NLG) tasks due to their complex causes. We systematically expand on the causes of factual hallucinations from the perspective of knowledge shortcuts, analyzing hallucinations arising from correct and defect-free data and demonstrating that knowledge-shortcut hallucinations are prevalent in generative models. To mitigate this issue, we propose a high similarity pruning algorithm at the data preprocessing level to reduce spurious correlations in the data. Additionally, we design a specific detection method for knowledge-shortcut hallucinations to evaluate the effectiveness of our mitigation strategy. Experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces knowledge-shortcut hallucinations, particularly in fine-tuning tasks, without negatively impacting model performance in question answering. This work introduces a new paradigm for mitigating specific hallucination issues in generative models, enhancing their robustness and reliability in real-world applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18556v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success of Large Vision-Language models(LVLMs), these models still suffer hallucinations when describing images, generating answers that include non-existent objects. It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations. Our IAVA approach is available online at https://github.com/Lee-lab558/IAVA.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[ShED-HD: A Shannon Entropy Distribution Framework for Lightweight Hallucination Detection on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18242v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[FactSelfCheck: Fact-Level Black-Box Hallucination Detection for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17229v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinated content, posing significant challenges for applications where factuality is crucial. While existing hallucination detection methods typically operate at the sentence level or passage level, we propose FactSelfCheck, a novel black-box sampling-based method that enables fine-grained fact-level detection. Our approach represents text as knowledge graphs consisting of facts in the form of triples. Through analyzing factual consistency across multiple LLM responses, we compute fine-grained hallucination scores without requiring external resources or training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that FactSelfCheck performs competitively with leading sampling-based methods while providing more detailed insights. Most notably, our fact-level approach significantly improves hallucination correction, achieving a 35% increase in factual content compared to the baseline, while sentence-level SelfCheckGPT yields only an 8% improvement. The granular nature of our detection enables more precise identification and correction of hallucinated content.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Don't Fight Hallucinations, Use Them: Estimating Image Realism using NLI over Atomic Facts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15948v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the realism of images remains a challenging problem in the field of artificial intelligence. For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of De-Factify 4: 4nd Workshop on Multimodal Fact Checking and Hate Speech Detection, co-located with AAAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[MASH-VLM: Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through Disentangled Spatial-Temporal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15871v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we tackle action-scene hallucination in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs), where models incorrectly predict actions based on the scene context or scenes based on observed actions. We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations in MLLMs via Multi-Frequency Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14895v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual-language tasks. However, the authenticity of the responses generated by MLLMs is often compromised by object hallucinations. We identify that a key cause of these hallucinations is the model's over-susceptibility to specific image frequency features in detecting objects. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Frequency Perturbations (MFP), a simple, cost-effective, and pluggable method that leverages both low-frequency and high-frequency features of images to perturb visual feature representations and explicitly suppress redundant frequency-domain features during inference, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates object hallucinations across various model architectures. Furthermore, as a training-time method, MFP can be combined with inference-time methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poly-FEVER: A Multilingual Fact Verification Benchmark for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16541v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in generative AI, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), pose a significant challenge to the reliability of multilingual applications. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection focus primarily on English and a few widely spoken languages, lacking the breadth to assess inconsistencies in model performance across diverse linguistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce Poly-FEVER, a large-scale multilingual fact verification benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs. Poly-FEVER comprises 77,973 labeled factual claims spanning 11 languages, sourced from FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact. It provides the first large-scale dataset tailored for analyzing hallucination patterns across languages, enabling systematic evaluation of LLMs such as ChatGPT and the LLaMA series. Our analysis reveals how topic distribution and web resource availability influence hallucination frequency, uncovering language-specific biases that impact model accuracy. By offering a multilingual benchmark for fact verification, Poly-FEVER facilitates cross-linguistic comparisons of hallucination detection and contributes to the development of more reliable, language-inclusive AI systems. The dataset is publicly available to advance research in responsible AI, fact-checking methodologies, and multilingual NLP, promoting greater transparency and robustness in LLM performance. The proposed Poly-FEVER is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/HanzhiZhang/Poly-FEVER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Verbal Uncertainty as a Linear Feature to Reduce Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14477v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs often adopt an assertive language style also when making false claims. Such ``overconfident hallucinations'' mislead users and erode trust. Achieving the ability to express in language the actual degree of uncertainty around a claim is therefore of great importance. We find that ``verbal uncertainty'' is governed by a single linear feature in the representation space of LLMs, and show that this has only moderate correlation with the actual ``semantic uncertainty'' of the model. We apply this insight and show that (1) the mismatch between semantic and verbal uncertainty is a better predictor of hallucinations than semantic uncertainty alone and (2) we can intervene on verbal uncertainty at inference time and reduce hallucinations on short-form answers, achieving an average relative reduction of 32%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From "Hallucination" to "Suture": Insights from Language Philosophy to Enhance Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14392v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores hallucination phenomena in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of language philosophy and psychoanalysis. By incorporating Lacan's concepts of the "chain of signifiers" and "suture points," we propose the Anchor-RAG framework as a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations. In contrast to the predominant reliance on trial-and-error experiments, constant adjustments of mathematical formulas, or resource-intensive methods that emphasize quantity over quality, our approach returns to the fundamental principles of linguistics to analyze the root causes of hallucinations in LLMs. Drawing from robust theoretical foundations, we derive algorithms and models that are not only effective in reducing hallucinations but also enhance LLM performance and improve output quality. This paper seeks to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding hallucinations in LLMs and aims to challenge the prevalent "guess-and-test" approach and rat race mentality in the field. We aspire to pave the way for a new era of interpretable LLMs, offering deeper insights into the inner workings of language-based AI systems.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[HDLCoRe: A Training-Free Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in LLM-Generated HDL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16528v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, when applied to hardware description languages (HDL), these models exhibit significant limitations due to data scarcity, resulting in hallucinations and incorrect code generation. To address these challenges, we propose HDLCoRe, a training-free framework that enhances LLMs' HDL generation capabilities through prompt engineering techniques and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our approach consists of two main components: (1) an HDL-aware Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique with self-verification that classifies tasks by complexity and type, incorporates domain-specific knowledge, and guides LLMs through step-by-step self-simulation for error correction; and (2) a two-stage heterogeneous RAG system that addresses formatting inconsistencies through key component extraction and efficiently retrieves relevant HDL examples through sequential filtering and re-ranking. HDLCoRe eliminates the need for model fine-tuning while substantially improving LLMs' HDL generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance on the RTLLM2.0 benchmark, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving both syntactic and functional correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13107v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Video-R1: Reinforcing Video Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21776v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for eliciting video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

However, effectively evaluating these MLLMs on face perception remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FaceBench, a dataset featuring hierarchical multi-view and multi-level attributes specifically designed to assess the comprehensive face perception abilities of MLLMs. Initially, we construct a hierarchical facial attribute structure, which encompasses five views with up to three levels of attributes, totaling over 210 attributes and 700 attribute values. Based on the structure, the proposed FaceBench consists of 49,919 visual question-answering (VQA) pairs for evaluation and 23,841 pairs for fine-tuning. Moreover, we further develop a robust face perception MLLM baseline, Face-LLaVA, by training with our proposed face VQA data. Extensive experiments on various mainstream MLLMs and Face-LLaVA are conducted to test their face perception ability, with results also compared against human performance. The results reveal that, the existing MLLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding the fine-grained facial attributes, while our Face-LLaVA significantly outperforms existing open-source models with a small amount of training data and is comparable to commercial ones like GPT-4o and Gemini. The dataset will be released at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/FaceBench.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

While existing preference alignment methods predominantly target hallucination factors, they overlook the factors essential for multi-modal comprehension capabilities, often narrowing their improvements on hallucination mitigation. To bridge this gap, we propose Instruction-oriented Preference Alignment (IPA), a scalable framework designed to automatically construct alignment preferences grounded in instruction fulfillment efficacy. Our method involves an automated preference construction coupled with a dedicated verification process that identifies instruction-oriented factors, avoiding significant variability in response representations. Additionally, IPA incorporates a progressive preference collection pipeline, further recalling challenging samples through model self-evolution and reference-guided refinement. Experiments conducted on Qwen2VL-7B demonstrate IPA's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including hallucination evaluation, visual question answering, and text understanding tasks, highlighting its capability to enhance general comprehension.</p></details> | Technical report |

To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce \textbf{LEGO-Puzzles}, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both \textbf{spatial understanding} and \textbf{sequential reasoning} in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90\% accuracy. In addition to VQA tasks, we evaluate MLLMs' abilities to generate LEGO images following assembly illustrations. Our experiments show that only Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Judge Anything: MLLM as a Judge Across Any Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17489v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating generative foundation models on open-ended multimodal understanding (MMU) and generation (MMG) tasks across diverse modalities (e.g., images, audio, video) poses significant challenges due to the complexity of cross-modal interactions. To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing vision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends MLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two benchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the overall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any modality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG capabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries curated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates the judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from the perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a standardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in assessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting and 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges with MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and 30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and hallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated platform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models. Our work highlights the need for fairer evaluation protocols and stronger alignment with human preferences.

| **[Visual Position Prompt for MLLM based Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15426v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address this issue, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM equipped with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms. The global VPP overlays learnable, axis-like embeddings onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues. The local VPP focuses on fine-grained localization by incorporating position-aware queries, which suggests probable object locations. We also introduce a VPP-SFT dataset with 0.6M samples, consolidating high-quality visual grounding data into a compact format for efficient model training. Training on this dataset with VPP enhances the model's performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard grounding benchmarks despite using fewer training samples compared to other MLLMs like MiniGPT-v2, which rely on much larger datasets ($\sim$21M samples). The code and VPP-SFT dataset will be available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by typical processes of humans, we hypothesize that the perception capabilities to extract meaningful information from diagrams is crucial, as it directly impacts subsequent inference processes. To validate this hypothesis, we developed FlowVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes all information used during problem-solving into four components, which are then combined into six problem versions for evaluation. Our preliminary results on FlowVerse reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit substantial limitations when extracting essential information and reasoned property from diagrams and performing complex reasoning based on these visual inputs. In response, we introduce MathFlow, a modular problem-solving pipeline that decouples perception and inference into distinct stages, thereby optimizing each independently. Given the perceptual limitations observed in current MLLMs, we trained MathFlow-P-7B as a dedicated perception model. Experimental results indicate that MathFlow-P-7B yields substantial performance gains when integrated with various closed-source and open-source inference models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the MathFlow pipeline and its compatibility to diverse inference frameworks. The FlowVerse benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/MathFlow-zju/MathFlow.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/MathFlow-zju/MathFlow</p></details> |

However, the authenticity of the responses generated by MLLMs is often compromised by object hallucinations. We identify that a key cause of these hallucinations is the model's over-susceptibility to specific image frequency features in detecting objects. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Frequency Perturbations (MFP), a simple, cost-effective, and pluggable method that leverages both low-frequency and high-frequency features of images to perturb visual feature representations and explicitly suppress redundant frequency-domain features during inference, thereby mitigating hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates object hallucinations across various model architectures. Furthermore, as a training-time method, MFP can be combined with inference-time methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CHAIR benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.

However, unlike natural images or documents, GUIs comprise artificially designed graphical elements arranged to convey specific semantic meanings. Current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) already proficient in processing graphical and textual components suffer from hurdles in GUI understanding due to the lack of explicit spatial structure modeling. Moreover, obtaining high-quality spatial structure data is challenging due to privacy issues and noisy environments. To address these challenges, we present MP-GUI, a specially designed MLLM for GUI understanding. MP-GUI features three precisely specialized perceivers to extract graphical, textual, and spatial modalities from the screen as GUI-tailored visual clues, with spatial structure refinement strategy and adaptively combined via a fusion gate to meet the specific preferences of different GUI understanding tasks. To cope with the scarcity of training data, we also introduce a pipeline for automatically data collecting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MP-GUI achieves impressive results on various GUI understanding tasks with limited data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, inherent challenges like long-tailed class distributions and prediction variability necessitate uncertainty quantification in SGG for its practical viability. In this paper, we introduce a novel Conformal Prediction (CP) based framework, adaptive to any existing SGG method, for quantifying their predictive uncertainty by constructing well-calibrated prediction sets over their generated scene graphs. These scene graph prediction sets are designed to achieve statistically rigorous coverage guarantees. Additionally, to ensure these prediction sets contain the most practically interpretable scene graphs, we design an effective MLLM-based post-processing strategy for selecting the most visually and semantically plausible scene graphs within these prediction sets. We show that our proposed approach can produce diverse possible scene graphs from an image, assess the reliability of SGG methods, and improve overall SGG performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference.</p></details> |  |

In this context, we identify two key challenges: cross-modal distraction and geometric feasibility. Cross-modal distraction occurs when the inclusion of visual input degrades the reasoning performance of a MLLM. Geometric feasibility refers to the ability of MLLMs to ensure that the selected skills are physically executable in the environment. To address these issues, we adapt Chain of Thought (CoT) with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and use affordance predictor as skill preconditions to guide MLLM on geometric feasibility. We construct a dataset to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning and collision avoidance. We conducted a detailed evaluation to identify issues among different baselines and analyze the reasons for improvement, providing insights into each approach. Our method reaches a success rate of 76.7% on the entire dataset, showing a substantial improvement over the CoT baseline at 36.7%.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce EMA, an Efficient Motion-Aware video MLLM that utilizes compressed video structures as inputs. We propose a motion-aware GOP (Group of Pictures) encoder that fuses spatial and motion information within a GOP unit in the compressed video stream, generating compact, informative visual tokens. By integrating fewer but denser RGB frames with more but sparser motion vectors in this native slow-fast input architecture, our approach reduces redundancy and enhances motion representation. Additionally, we introduce MotionBench, a benchmark for evaluating motion understanding across four motion types: linear, curved, rotational, and contact-based. Experimental results show that EMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both MotionBench and popular video question answering benchmarks, while reducing inference costs. Moreover, EMA demonstrates strong scalability, as evidenced by its competitive performance on long video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

| **[Towards Self-Improving Systematic Cognition for Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges with fine-grained perception and complex reasoning. Prevalent multimodal pre-training approaches in MLLM construction focus on enhancing perception by training on high-quality image captions. While leveraging advanced MLLMs for caption generation enhances scalability, their outputs often lack comprehensiveness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework designed to construct next-generation foundation MLLMs by enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description (CoD), an approach that improves an MLLM's systematic perception by enabling step-by-step visual understanding. CoD sequentially focuses on salient content, fine-grained details, relational attributes, and peripheral context, before generating a coherent description, ensuring greater accuracy and comprehensiveness. Additionally, we adopt a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning technique to enable MLLMs to integrate in-depth multimodal reasoning. To construct a next-generation foundation MLLM with self-improved cognition, SIcog first equips an MLLM with systematic perception and reasoning abilities using minimal external annotations. The enhanced models then generate detailed captions and CoT reasoning data, which are further curated through self-consistency. This curated data is ultimately used for multimodal pre-training to develop next-generation foundation models. Extensive experiments on both low- and high-resolution MLLMs across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with significantly improved cognition, achieving benchmark-leading performance compared to prevalent pre-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages.

| **[CINEMA: Coherent Multi-Subject Video Generation via MLLM-Based Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10391v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has witnessed remarkable progress with the advent of deep generative models, particularly diffusion models. While existing methods excel in generating high-quality videos from text prompts or single images, personalized multi-subject video generation remains a largely unexplored challenge. This task involves synthesizing videos that incorporate multiple distinct subjects, each defined by separate reference images, while ensuring temporal and spatial consistency. Current approaches primarily rely on mapping subject images to keywords in text prompts, which introduces ambiguity and limits their ability to model subject relationships effectively. In this paper, we propose CINEMA, a novel framework for coherent multi-subject video generation by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach eliminates the need for explicit correspondences between subject images and text entities, mitigating ambiguity and reducing annotation effort. By leveraging MLLM to interpret subject relationships, our method facilitates scalability, enabling the use of large and diverse datasets for training. Furthermore, our framework can be conditioned on varying numbers of subjects, offering greater flexibility in personalized content creation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves subject consistency, and overall video coherence, paving the way for advanced applications in storytelling, interactive media, and personalized video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 14.3% compared with SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Density Principle for MLLM Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10079v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hundreds of benchmarks have been developed to ensure the reliability of MLLMs in downstream tasks. However, the evaluation mechanism itself may not be reliable. For developers of MLLMs, questions remain about which benchmark to use and whether the test results meet their requirements. Therefore, we propose a critical principle of Information Density, which examines how much insight a benchmark can provide for the development of MLLMs. We characterize it from four key dimensions: (1) Fallacy, (2) Difficulty, (3) Redundancy, (4) Diversity. Through a comprehensive analysis of more than 10,000 samples, we measured the information density of 19 MLLM benchmarks. Experiments show that using the latest benchmarks in testing can provide more insight compared to previous ones, but there is still room for improvement in their information density. We hope this principle can promote the development and application of future MLLM benchmarks. Project page: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/bench4bench</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 16 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-COT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 35.8% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form, plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted. Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80% while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in automotive systems.</p></details> |  |

While recent works equip reinforcement learning (RL)-based LRMs with retrieval capabilities, they suffer from overthinking and lack robustness in reasoning, reducing their effectiveness in question answering (QA) tasks. To address this, we propose ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that explores diverse queries without excessive iterations. Our solution includes a novel data construction framework with an upper bound on the reasoning chain length. Specifically, we first leverage an LRM to generate deliberate thinking, then select an action from a predefined action space (Search and Finish). For Search action, a query is executed against the RAG engine, where the result is returned as observation to guide reasoning steps later. This process iterates until a Finish action is chosen. Benefiting from ReaRAG's strong reasoning capabilities, our approach outperforms existing baselines on multi-hop QA. Further analysis highlights its strong reflective ability to recognize errors and refine its reasoning trajectory. Our study enhances LRMs' factuality while effectively integrating robust reasoning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).</p></details> |  |

Although recent advancements in models with vision and audio understanding capabilities have shown substantial progress, the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework for thoroughly assessing their cross-modality perception performance. We introduce MAVERIX~(Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation Reasoning IndeX), a novel benchmark with 700 videos and 2,556 questions explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through tasks that necessitate close integration of video and audio information. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show performance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts reach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in embodied domains which require continuous interaction with environments through image action interleaved trajectories remains largely -unexplored. We present Embodied Reasoner, a model that extends o1 style reasoning to interactive embodied search tasks. Unlike mathematical reasoning that relies primarily on logical deduction, embodied scenarios demand spatial understanding, temporal reasoning, and ongoing self-reflection based on interaction history. To address these challenges, we synthesize 9.3k coherent Observation-Thought-Action trajectories containing 64k interactive images and 90k diverse thinking processes (analysis, spatial reasoning, reflection, planning, and verification). We develop a three-stage training pipeline that progressively enhances the model's capabilities through imitation learning, self-exploration via rejection sampling, and self-correction through reflection tuning. The evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms those advanced visual reasoning models, e.g., it exceeds OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Claude-3.7 by +9\%, 24\%, and +13\%. Analysis reveals our model exhibits fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistencies, with particular advantages in complex long-horizon tasks. Real-world environments also show our superiority while exhibiting fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistency cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/zwq2018/embodied_reasoner Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwq2018/embodied_reasoner</p></details> |

However, a growing concern lies in their tendency to produce excessively long reasoning traces, which are often filled with redundant content (e.g., repeated definitions), over-analysis of simple problems, and superficial exploration of multiple reasoning paths for harder tasks. This inefficiency introduces significant challenges for training, inference, and real-world deployment (e.g., in agent-based systems), where token economy is critical. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent efforts aimed at improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with a particular focus on the unique challenges that arise in this new paradigm. We identify common patterns of inefficiency, examine methods proposed across the LRM lifecycle, i.e., from pretraining to inference, and discuss promising future directions for research. To support ongoing development, we also maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking recent progress in the field. We hope this survey serves as a foundation for further exploration and inspires innovation in this rapidly evolving area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey, 32 pages, Large Reasoning Models, Efficient Reasoning for Language, Multimodality, and Beyond</p></details> |

With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional cross-modal relational reasoning capabilities and generalization capacities, thereby opening up novel pathways for overcoming the inherent limitations of conventional graph learning paradigms. However, current research predominantly concentrates on investigating the single-graph reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which fundamentally fails to address the critical requirement for coordinated reasoning across multiple heterogeneous graph data in real-world application scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose the first multi-graph joint reasoning benchmark for VLMs. Our benchmark encompasses four graph categories: knowledge graphs, flowcharts, mind maps, and route maps,with each graph group accompanied by three progressively challenging instruction-response pairs. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted comprehensive capability assessments of state-of-the-art VLMs and performed fine-tuning on open-source models. This study not only addresses the underexplored evaluation gap in multi-graph reasoning for VLMs but also empirically validates their generalization superiority in graph-structured learning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore federated fine-tuning and collaborative reasoning techniques to facilitate the implementation of large AI models in resource-constrained wireless networks. Firstly, promising applications of large AI models within specific domains are discussed. Subsequently, federated fine-tuning methods are proposed to adapt large AI models to specific tasks or environments at the network edge, effectively addressing the challenges associated with communication overhead and enhancing communication efficiency. These methodologies follow clustered, hierarchical, and asynchronous paradigms to effectively tackle privacy issues and eliminate data silos. Furthermore, to enhance operational efficiency and reduce latency, efficient frameworks for model collaborative reasoning are developed, which include decentralized horizontal collaboration, cloud-edge-end vertical collaboration, and multi-access collaboration. Next, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in reducing the fine-tuning loss of large AI models across various downstream tasks. Finally, several open challenges and research opportunities are outlined.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce OlymMATH, a novel Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously test the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems, each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The problems are systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models. In our benchmark, these problems span four core mathematical fields, each including a verifiable numerical solution to enable objective, rule-based evaluation. Empirical results underscore the significant challenge presented by OlymMATH, with state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o3-mini demonstrating notably limited accuracy on the hard subset. Furthermore, the benchmark facilitates comprehensive bilingual assessment of mathematical reasoning abilities-a critical dimension that remains largely unaddressed in mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We release the OlymMATH benchmark at the STILL project: https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Slow_Thinking_with_LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report on Slow Thinking with LLMs: Evaluation Benchmark</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce ReFeed, a powerful summarization refinement pipeline that enhances multiple dimensions through reflective reasoning on feedback. To achieve this, we release SumFeed-CoT, a large-scale Long-CoT-based dataset optimized for training a lightweight model with reflective reasoning. Our experiments reveal how the number of dimensions, feedback exposure, and reasoning policy influence refinement performance, highlighting reflective reasoning and simultaneously addressing multiple feedback is crucial to mitigate trade-off between dimensions. Furthermore, ReFeed is robust to noisy feedback and feedback order. Lastly, our finding emphasizes that creating data with a proper goal and guideline constitutes a fundamental pillar of effective reasoning. The dataset and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising solution by evaluating each reasoning step. However, existing PRMs typically output evaluation scores directly, limiting both learning efficiency and evaluation accuracy, which is further exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated data. To address these issues, we propose Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling (R-PRM). First, we leverage stronger LLMs to generate seed data from limited annotations, effectively bootstrapping our model's reasoning capabilities and enabling comprehensive step-by-step evaluation. Second, we further enhance performance through preference optimization, without requiring additional annotated data. Third, we introduce inference-time scaling to fully harness the model's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate R-PRM's effectiveness: on ProcessBench and PRMBench, it surpasses strong baselines by 11.9 and 8.5 points in F1 scores, respectively. When applied to guide mathematical reasoning, R-PRM achieves consistent accuracy improvements of over 8.5 points across six challenging datasets. Further analysis reveals that R-PRM exhibits more comprehensive evaluation and stronger generalization capabilities, thereby highlighting its significant potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/R-PRM</p></details> |

However, the substantial domain gap among generative models makes it challenging to develop a generalizable forgery detection model. Moreover, since every pixel in an AI-generated image is synthesized, traditional saliency-based forgery explanation methods are not well suited for this task. To address these challenges, we propose modeling AI-generated image detection and explanation as a Forgery Detection and Reasoning task (FDR-Task), leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) to provide accurate detection through structured and reliable reasoning over forgery attributes. To facilitate this task, we introduce the Multi-Modal Forgery Reasoning dataset (MMFR-Dataset), a large-scale dataset containing 100K images across 10 generative models, with 10 types of forgery reasoning annotations, enabling comprehensive evaluation of FDR-Task. Additionally, we propose FakeReasoning, a forgery detection and reasoning framework with two key components. First, Forgery-Aligned Contrastive Learning enhances VLMs' understanding of forgery-related semantics through both cross-modal and intra-modal contrastive learning between images and forgery attribute reasoning. Second, a Classification Probability Mapper bridges the optimization gap between forgery detection and language modeling by mapping the output logits of VLMs to calibrated binary classification probabilities. Experiments across multiple generative models demonstrate that FakeReasoning not only achieves robust generalization but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both detection and reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[EQ-Negotiator: An Emotion-Reasoning LLM Agent in Credit Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have been applied for effective engagement in credit dialogues, their capacity for dynamic emotional expression remains limited. Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets, our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing satisfaction in credit services.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Operating Room Workflow Analysis via Reasoning Segmentation over Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21054v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing operating room (OR) workflows to derive quantitative insights into OR efficiency is important for hospitals to maximize patient care and financial sustainability. Prior work on OR-level workflow analysis has relied on end-to-end deep neural networks. While these approaches work well in constrained settings, they are limited to the conditions specified at development time and do not offer the flexibility necessary to accommodate the OR workflow analysis needs of various OR scenarios (e.g., large academic center vs. rural provider) without data collection, annotation, and retraining. Reasoning segmentation (RS) based on foundation models offers this flexibility by enabling automated analysis of OR workflows from OR video feeds given only an implicit text query related to the objects of interest. Due to the reliance on large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, current RS approaches struggle with reasoning about semantic/spatial relationships and show limited generalization to OR video due to variations in visual characteristics and domain-specific terminology. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel digital twin (DT) representation that preserves both semantic and spatial relationships between the various OR components. Then, building on this foundation, we propose ORDiRS (Operating Room Digital twin representation for Reasoning Segmentation), an LLM-tuning-free RS framework that reformulates RS into a "reason-retrieval-synthesize" paradigm. Finally, we present ORDiRS-Agent, an LLM-based agent that decomposes OR workflow analysis queries into manageable RS sub-queries and generates responses by combining detailed textual explanations with supporting visual evidence from RS. Experimental results on both an in-house and a public OR dataset demonstrate that our ORDiRS achieves a cIoU improvement of 6.12%-9.74% compared to the existing state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning for Structured Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20988v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to extract compact, meaningful summaries from large-scale and multimodal data is critical for numerous applications, ranging from video analytics to medical reports. Prior methods in cross-modal summarization have often suffered from high computational overheads and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning} (\textbf{CSS-GR}) framework that incorporates a state-space model with graph-based message passing, inspired by prior work on efficient state-space models. Unlike existing approaches relying on purely sequential models, our method constructs a graph that captures inter- and intra-modal relationships, allowing more holistic reasoning over both textual and visual streams. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves summarization quality and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency, as validated on standard multimodal summarization benchmarks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reason-RFT: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20752v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning abilities play a crucial role in understanding complex multimodal data, advancing both domain-specific applications and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods improve VLM reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning, using meticulously annotated training data to enhance visual reasoning capabilities. However, this training paradigm may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, restricting the model's ability to transfer visual reasoning skills across domains and limiting its real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning framework that significantly enhances generalization capabilities in visual reasoning tasks. Reason-RFT introduces a two-phase training framework for visual reasoning: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data activates the reasoning potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), followed by (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning that generates multiple reasoning-response pairs, significantly enhancing generalization in visual reasoning tasks. To evaluate Reason-RFT's visual reasoning capabilities, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset spanning visual counting, structure perception, and spatial transformation. Experimental results demonstrate Reasoning-RFT's three key advantages: (1) Performance Enhancement: achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, outperforming most mainstream open-source and proprietary models; (2) Generalization Superiority: consistently maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks and domains, outperforming alternative training paradigms; (3) Data Efficiency: excelling in few-shot learning scenarios while surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines.

Previous methods focus on the learning of object-level representations and ignore the scene-level information, thus it is hard to distinguish objects with similar classes. In this work, we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Reason and Debate with PSL (GLRD) framework for the 3D OVD task, considering both local object-level information and global scene-level information. Specifically, LLM is utilized to perform common sense reasoning based on object-level and scene-level information, where the detection result is refined accordingly. To further boost the LLM's ability of precise decisions, we also design a probabilistic soft logic solver (OV-PSL) to search for the optimal solution, and a debate scheme to confirm the class of confusable objects. In addition, to alleviate the uneven distribution of classes, a static balance scheme (SBC) and a dynamic balance scheme (DBC) are designed. In addition, to reduce the influence of noise in data and training, we further propose Reflected Pseudo Labels Generation (RPLG) and Background-Aware Object Localization (BAOL). Extensive experiments conducted on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D demonstrate the superiority of GLRD, where absolute improvements in mean average precision are $+2.82\%$ on SUN RGB-D and $+3.72\%$ on ScanNet in the partial open-vocabulary setting. In the full open-vocabulary setting, the absolute improvements in mean average precision are $+4.03\%$ on ScanNet and $+14.11\%$ on SUN RGB-D.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While recent studies have developed link prediction (LP) methods to infer missing relations for knowledge graphs (KGs) containing n-ary relational facts, they are generally limited to transductive settings. Fully inductive settings, where predictions are made on previously unseen entities, remain a significant challenge. As existing methods are mainly entity embedding-based, they struggle to capture entity-independent logical rules. To fill in this gap, we propose an n-ary subgraph reasoning framework for fully inductive link prediction (ILP) on n-ary relational facts. This framework reasons over local subgraphs and has a strong inductive inference ability to capture n-ary patterns. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph structure, the n-ary semantic hypergraph, to facilitate subgraph extraction. Moreover, we develop a subgraph aggregating network, NS-HART, to effectively mine complex semantic correlations within subgraphs. Theoretically, we provide a thorough analysis from the score function optimization perspective to shed light on NS-HART's effectiveness for n-ary ILP tasks. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on a series of inductive benchmarks, including transfer reasoning (with and without entity features) and pairwise subgraph reasoning. The results highlight the superiority of the n-ary subgraph reasoning framework and the exceptional inductive ability of NS-HART.

However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

| **[Multi-head Reward Aggregation Guided by Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20995v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with safety guidelines typically involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), relying on human-generated preference annotations. However, assigning consistent overall quality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards detailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper uncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating entropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by humans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward entropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules exhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that rules with elevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry optimization framework, justifying our entropy-based penalization. Through extensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, our method significantly surpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods. Our proposed approach is training-free, broadly applicable to various datasets, and maintains interpretability, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-attribute reward modeling.</p></details> |  |

Despite its advantages, evaluation on PRMs remains less explored, especially in the multimodal domain. To address this gap, this paper first benchmarks current vision large language models (VLLMs) as two types of reward models: output reward models (ORMs) and process reward models (PRMs) on multiple vision-language benchmarks, which reveal that neither ORM nor PRM consistently outperforms across all tasks, and superior VLLMs do not necessarily yield better rewarding performance. To further advance evaluation, we introduce ViLBench, a vision-language benchmark designed to require intensive process reward signals. Notably, OpenAI's GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) achieves only 27.3% accuracy, indicating the benchmark's challenge for current VLLMs. Lastly, we preliminarily showcase a promising pathway towards bridging the gap between general VLLMs and reward models -- by collecting 73.6K vision-language process reward data using an enhanced tree-search algorithm, our 3B model is able to achieve an average improvement of 3.3% over standard CoT and up to 2.5% compared to its untrained counterpart on ViLBench by selecting OpenAI o1's generations. We release the implementations at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/ViLBench with our code, model, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAPO: Learning Preferential Prompt through Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20194v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints. While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO. Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs.

While large language models (LLMs) excel in many reasoning tasks, their ability to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for text-to-SQL remains underexplored. We identify critical limitations: zero-shot CoT offers minimal gains, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied without CoT yields marginal improvements. We propose ExCoT, a novel framework that iteratively optimizes open-source LLMs by combining CoT reasoning with off-policy and on-policy DPO, relying solely on execution accuracy as feedback. This approach eliminates the need for reward models or human-annotated preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains: ExCoT improves execution accuracy on BIRD dev set from 57.37% to 68.51% and on Spider test set from 78.81% to 86.59% for LLaMA-3 70B, with Qwen-2.5-Coder demonstrating similar improvements. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single-model setting on both BIRD and Spider datasets, notably achieving 68.53% on the BIRD test set.</p></details> |  |

These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well.

However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we frame game balancing as a procedural content generation task and propose an architecture for automatically balancing of tile-based levels within the PCGRL framework (procedural content generation via reinforcement learning). Our architecture is divided into three parts: (1) a level generator, (2) a balancing agent, and (3) a reward modeling simulation. Through repeated simulations, the balancing agent receives rewards for adjusting the level towards a given balancing objective, such as equal win rates for all players. To this end, we propose new swap-based representations to improve the robustness of playability, thereby enabling agents to balance game levels more effectively and quickly compared to traditional PCGRL. By analyzing the agent's swapping behavior, we can infer which tile types have the most impact on the balance. We validate our approach in the Neural MMO (NMMO) environment in a competitive two-player scenario. In this extended conference paper, we present improved results, explore the applicability of the method to various forms of balancing beyond equal balancing, compare the performance to another search-based approach, and discuss the application of existing fairness metrics to game balancing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the journal (IEEE Transactions on Games) paper of the same name</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-wise Multi-dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling.

| **[SRMIR: Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18991v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and values is vital for application. However, current alignment methods face three main limitations: (1) reliance on costly human annotation; (2) alignment tax; (3) shallow alignment vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Additionally, current alignment datasets often suffer from uneven distributions, leading to overrepresentation of some topics and neglect of others. To address these issues, we propose SRMIR (Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning), inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. We first construct a balanced safety Chain of Draft (CoD) dataset across $7$ harmful types with structured prompt leveraging the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs, then train a set of specialized reward models to guide policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We apply two strategies, linear combination and categorized approach, to integrate shadow reward models for policy optimization. By comparison, we find that the latter achieves superior alignment despite higher computational costs. Experiments across several LLMs demonstrate SRMIR significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Reward Over-Optimization in RLHF via Behavior-Supported Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18130v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an effective method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, reward over-optimization remains an open challenge leading to discrepancies between the performance of LLMs under the reward model and the true human objectives. A primary contributor to reward over-optimization is the extrapolation error that arises when the reward model evaluates out-of-distribution (OOD) responses. However, current methods still fail to prevent the increasing frequency of OOD response generation during the reinforcement learning (RL) process and are not effective at handling extrapolation errors from OOD responses. In this work, we propose the Behavior-Supported Policy Optimization (BSPO) method to mitigate the reward over-optimization issue. Specifically, we define behavior policy as the next token distribution of the reward training dataset to model the in-distribution (ID) region of the reward model. Building on this, we introduce the behavior-supported Bellman operator to regularize the value function, penalizing all OOD values without impacting the ID ones. Consequently, BSPO reduces the generation of OOD responses during the RL process, thereby avoiding overestimation caused by the reward model's extrapolation errors. Theoretically, we prove that BSPO guarantees a monotonic improvement of the supported policy until convergence to the optimal behavior-supported policy. Empirical results from extensive experiments show that BSPO outperforms baselines in preventing reward over-optimization due to OOD evaluation and finding the optimal ID policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, preference optimization, derived from the language domain, has emerged as an effective post-training reinforcement strategy to enhance capabilities of LVLMs. However, constructing high-quality human-annotated preference data and developing robust reward models to mimic these preferences are both costly and challenging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Vision-R1, a novel vision-guided R1-like reinforcement learning algorithm for LVLMs that rewards models with definitive vision feedback. It only leverages curated instruction data, eliminating the need for specialized reward models and handcrafted preference datasets. We incorporate a criterion-driven reward function that further integrates multi-dimensional feedback to evaluate model completions comprehensively based on the vision task logic. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive rule refinement strategy that dynamically adjusts the reward criteria during training, enabling continuous model improvement and mitigating reward hacking. Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning the 7B LVLMs with Vision-R1 achieves consistent performance gains, with even up to 50% improvement and surpassing the state-of-the-art 10x size model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project in development.

| **[OMR-Diffusion:Optimizing Multi-Round Enhanced Training in Diffusion Models for Improved Intent Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17660v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has significantly advanced text-driven image generation, but it still faces challenges in producing outputs that consistently align with evolving user preferences and intents, particularly in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. In this research, We present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback, utilizing a well-trained reward model specifically designed to closely align with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, the framework applies multiple reward functions (such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback) to refine the diffusion model through LoRA, effectively optimizing image generation based on user input. We also constructed multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and image pairs that well-fit user intent. Experiments show the model achieves 508 wins in human evaluation, outperforming DALL-E 3 (463 wins) and others. It also achieves 3.4 rounds in dialogue efficiency (vs. 13.7 for DALL-E 3) and excels in metrics like LPIPS (0.15) and BLIP (0.59). Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, with significant improvements in image consistency and alignment with user intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Judge Anything: MLLM as a Judge Across Any Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17489v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating generative foundation models on open-ended multimodal understanding (MMU) and generation (MMG) tasks across diverse modalities (e.g., images, audio, video) poses significant challenges due to the complexity of cross-modal interactions. To this end, the idea of utilizing Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as automated judges has emerged, with encouraging results in assessing vision-language understanding tasks. Moving further, this paper extends MLLM-as-a-Judge across modalities to a unified manner by introducing two benchmarks, TaskAnything and JudgeAnything, to respectively evaluate the overall performance and judging capabilities of MLLMs across any-to-any modality tasks. Specifically, TaskAnything evaluates the MMU and MMG capabilities across 15 any-to-any modality categories, employing 1,500 queries curated from well-established benchmarks. Furthermore, JudgeAnything evaluates the judging capabilities of 5 advanced (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash) from the perspectives of Pair Comparison and Score Evaluation, providing a standardized testbed that incorporates human judgments and detailed rubrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that while these MLLMs show promise in assessing MMU (i.e., achieving an average of 66.55% in Pair Comparison setting and 42.79% in Score Evaluation setting), they encounter significant challenges with MMG tasks (i.e., averaging only 53.37% in Pair Comparison setting and 30.05% in Score Evaluation setting), exposing cross-modality biases and hallucination issues. To address this, we present OmniArena, an automated platform for evaluating omni-models and multimodal reward models. Our work highlights the need for fairer evaluation protocols and stronger alignment with human preferences.

| **[Dancing with Critiques: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Stepwise Natural Language Self-Critique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17363v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex tasks requiring multi-step logical deductions, remains a significant challenge. Traditional inference time scaling methods utilize scalar reward signals from process reward models to evaluate candidate reasoning steps, but these scalar rewards lack the nuanced qualitative information essential for understanding and justifying each step. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time scaling approach -- stepwise natural language self-critique (PANEL), which employs self-generated natural language critiques as feedback to guide the step-level search process. By generating rich, human-readable critiques for each candidate reasoning step, PANEL retains essential qualitative information, facilitating better-informed decision-making during inference. This approach bypasses the need for task-specific verifiers and the associated training overhead, making it broadly applicable across diverse tasks. Experimental results on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including AIME and GPQA, demonstrate that PANEL significantly enhances reasoning performance, outperforming traditional scalar reward-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/puddingyeah/PANEL to support and encourage future research in this promising field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17338v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward model that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We propose a method to specialise a reward model to a person or group of people. Our approach builds on the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive reward model and also adaptive counterparts, including models that do in-context personalisation. Depending on how much disagreement there is in the training data, our model either significantly outperforms the baselines or matches their performance with a simpler architecture and more stable training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Additive Contextual Bandits: A Nonparametric Approach for Online Decision-making with High-dimensional Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16941v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized services are central to today's digital landscape, where online decision-making is commonly formulated as contextual bandit problems. Two key challenges emerge in modern applications: high-dimensional covariates and the need for nonparametric models to capture complex reward-covariate relationships. We address these challenges by developing a contextual bandit algorithm based on sparse additive reward models in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We establish statistical properties of the doubly penalized method applied to random regions, introducing novel analyses under bandit feedback. Our algorithm achieves sublinear cumulative regret over the time horizon $T$ while scaling logarithmically with covariate dimensionality $d$. Notably, we provide the first regret upper bound with logarithmic growth in $d$ for nonparametric contextual bandits with high-dimensional covariates. We also establish a lower bound, with the gap to the upper bound vanishing as smoothness increases. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance in high-dimensional settings compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScalingNoise: Scaling Inference-Time Search for Generating Infinite Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16400v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality videos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts during training through improvements in data quality, computational resources, and model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less attention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation attempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of "golden noises" that can enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that guiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise candidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the current step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing the anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term value. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible adjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step denoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant long-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a plug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial noises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency and visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert initial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value, leveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover, to preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution that up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly reduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally consistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cultural Alignment in Large Language Models Using Soft Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16094v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) alignment conventionally relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning based alignment frameworks. These methods typically require labeled or preference datasets and involve updating model weights to align the LLM with the training objective or reward model. Meanwhile, in social sciences such as cross-cultural studies, factor analysis is widely used to uncover underlying dimensions or latent variables that explain observed patterns in survey data. The non-differentiable nature of these measurements deriving from survey data renders the former alignment methods infeasible for alignment with cultural dimensions. To overcome this, we propose a parameter efficient strategy that combines soft prompt tuning, which freezes the model parameters while modifying the input prompt embeddings, with Differential Evolution (DE), a black-box optimization method for cases where a differentiable objective is unattainable. This strategy ensures alignment consistency without the need for preference data or model parameter updates, significantly enhancing efficiency and mitigating overfitting. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in LLama-3-8B-Instruct's cultural dimensions across multiple regions, outperforming both the Naive LLM and the In-context Learning (ICL) baseline, and effectively bridges computational models with human cultural nuances.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/princeton-pli/what-makes-good-rm</p></details> |
