| **[Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16853v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Under review</p></details> |
| **[ReasonGRM: Enhancing Generative Reward Models through Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16712v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reward Modeling via Causal Rubrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16507v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors, leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically, Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N, across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat, chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and the reasoning-specific GSM8k.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relic: Enhancing Reward Model Generalization for Low-Resource Indic Languages with Few-Shot Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16502v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13% improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example selection method, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16114v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem. Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARE: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation for Automatic Process Supervision and Reward Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15498v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main content, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reward Models in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15421v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025 Survey Track (To Appear)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Accompaniment with ReaLchords](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14723v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jamming requires coordination, anticipation, and collaborative creativity between musicians. Current generative models of music produce expressive output but are not able to generate in an \emph{online} manner, meaning simultaneously with other musicians (human or otherwise). We propose ReaLchords, an online generative model for improvising chord accompaniment to user melody. We start with an online model pretrained by maximum likelihood, and use reinforcement learning to finetune the model for online use. The finetuning objective leverages both a novel reward model that provides feedback on both harmonic and temporal coherency between melody and chord, and a divergence term that implements a novel type of distillation from a teacher model that can see the future melody. Through quantitative experiments and listening tests, we demonstrate that the resulting model adapts well to unfamiliar input and produce fitting accompaniment. ReaLchords opens the door to live jamming, as well as simultaneous co-creation in other modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[SENIOR: Efficient Query Selection and Preference-Guided Exploration in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14648v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) methods provide a solution to avoid reward engineering by learning reward models based on human preferences. However, poor feedback- and sample- efficiency still remain the problems that hinder the application of PbRL. In this paper, we present a novel efficient query selection and preference-guided exploration method, called SENIOR, which could select the meaningful and easy-to-comparison behavior segment pairs to improve human feedback-efficiency and accelerate policy learning with the designed preference-guided intrinsic rewards. Our key idea is twofold: (1) We designed a Motion-Distinction-based Selection scheme (MDS). It selects segment pairs with apparent motion and different directions through kernel density estimation of states, which is more task-related and easy for human preference labeling; (2) We proposed a novel preference-guided exploration method (PGE). It encourages the exploration towards the states with high preference and low visits and continuously guides the agent achieving the valuable samples. The synergy between the two mechanisms could significantly accelerate the progress of reward and policy learning. Our experiments show that SENIOR outperforms other five existing methods in both human feedback-efficiency and policy convergence speed on six complex robot manipulation tasks from simulation and four real-worlds.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[TGDPO: Harnessing Token-Level Reward Guidance for Enhancing Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14574v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning from human feedback have shown that utilizing fine-grained token-level reward models can substantially enhance the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in aligning large language models. However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/TGDPO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Adaptive Data Augmentation for Thompson Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14479v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In linear contextual bandits, the objective is to select actions that maximize cumulative rewards, modeled as a linear function with unknown parameters. Although Thompson Sampling performs well empirically, it does not achieve optimal regret bounds. This paper proposes a nearly minimax optimal Thompson Sampling for linear contextual bandits by developing a novel estimator with the adaptive augmentation and coupling of the hypothetical samples that are designed for efficient parameter learning. The proposed estimator accurately predicts rewards for all arms without relying on assumptions for the context distribution. Empirical results show robust performance and significant improvement over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAM: A Generative Foundation Reward Model for Reward Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14175v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In aligning large language models (LLMs), reward models have played an important role, but are standardly trained as discriminative models and rely only on labeled human preference data. In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[VL-GenRM: Enhancing Vision-Language Verification via Vision Experts and Iterative Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13888v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with verifiable rewards has advanced large language models but remains underexplored for Vision-Language (VL) models. The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training. To address these issues, we propose an iterative training framework leveraging vision experts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling. Our approach refines preference datasets, enhances structured critiques, and iteratively improves reasoning. Experiments across VL-RM benchmarks demonstrate superior performance in hallucination detection and multimodal reasoning, advancing VL model alignment with reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fake it till You Make it: Reward Modeling as Discriminative Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13846v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).</p></details> |  |
| **[PB$^2$: Preference Space Exploration via Population-Based Methods in Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13741v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning behaviors from human feedback without predefined reward functions. However, current PbRL methods face a critical challenge in effectively exploring the preference space, often converging prematurely to suboptimal policies that satisfy only a narrow subset of human preferences. In this work, we identify and address this preference exploration problem through population-based methods. We demonstrate that maintaining a diverse population of agents enables more comprehensive exploration of the preference landscape compared to single-agent approaches. Crucially, this diversity improves reward model learning by generating preference queries with clearly distinguishable behaviors, a key factor in real-world scenarios where humans must easily differentiate between options to provide meaningful feedback. Our experiments reveal that current methods may fail by getting stuck in local optima, requiring excessive feedback, or degrading significantly when human evaluators make errors on similar trajectories, a realistic scenario often overlooked by methods relying on perfect oracle teachers. Our population-based approach demonstrates robust performance when teachers mislabel similar trajectory segments and shows significantly enhanced preference exploration capabilities,particularly in environments with complex reward landscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\texttt{SPECS}$: Faster Test-Time Scaling through Speculative Drafts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15733v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding. $\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement learning objective with increasing beam width.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Outcomes to Processes: Guiding PRM Learning from ORM for Inference-Time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12446v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12350v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.</p></details> |  |
| **[TreeRL: LLM Reinforcement Learning with On-Policy Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11902v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching. Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL, highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM.

| **[No Free Lunch: Rethinking Internal Feedback for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17219v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Mental Imagery: Empower Multimodal Reasoning with Latent Visual Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17218v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vlm-mirage.github.io/</p></details> |

The standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these, we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail, BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT + RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can substantially boost SLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mathematical Proof as a Litmus Test: Revealing Failure Modes of Advanced Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17114v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEXA: Towards General Multimodal Reasoning with Dynamic Multi-Expert Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17113v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally; Github link: https://github.com/Yui010206/MEXA</p></details> |
| **[Towards Advanced Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs via First-Order Logic Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17104v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL) reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM, a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs' generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Step-by-Step and Verifiable Medical Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16962v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

| **[Co-VisiON: Co-Visibility ReasONing on Sparse Image Sets of Indoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16805v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in 3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

| **[Language-Informed Synthesis of Rational Agent Models for Grounded Theory-of-Mind Reasoning On-The-Fly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16755v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed. In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments. On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing human judgments across all domains.</p></details> | 5 figures, 19 pages |
| **[DRARL: Disengagement-Reason-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Improvement of Autonomous Driving Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16720v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing presence of automated vehicles on open roads under driver supervision, disengagement cases are becoming more prevalent. While some data-driven planning systems attempt to directly utilize these disengagement cases for policy improvement, the inherent scarcity of disengagement data (often occurring as a single instances) restricts training effectiveness. Furthermore, some disengagement data should be excluded since the disengagement may not always come from the failure of driving policies, e.g. the driver may casually intervene for a while. To this end, this work proposes disengagement-reason-augmented reinforcement learning (DRARL), which enhances driving policy improvement process according to the reason of disengagement cases. Specifically, the reason of disengagement is identified by a out-of-distribution (OOD) state estimation model. When the reason doesn't exist, the case will be identified as a casual disengagement case, which doesn't require additional policy adjustment. Otherwise, the policy can be updated under a reason-augmented imagination environment, improving the policy performance of disengagement cases with similar reasons. The method is evaluated using real-world disengagement cases collected by autonomous driving robotaxi. Experimental results demonstrate that the method accurately identifies policy-related disengagement reasons, allowing the agent to handle both original and semantically similar cases through reason-augmented training. Furthermore, the approach prevents the agent from becoming overly conservative after policy adjustments. Overall, this work provides an efficient way to improve driving policy performance with disengagement cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReasonGRM: Enhancing Generative Reward Models through Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16712v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-driven Description Generation and Common Sense Reasoning for Video Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16701v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain. However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging Action Genome and Charades datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoGuess: Multimodal Reasoning based on Hierarchy of Visual Information in Street View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16633v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.</p></details> |  |
| **[ML-Master: Towards AI-for-AI via Integration of Exploration and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16499v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves. While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods, particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Under the Shadow of Babel: How Language Shapes Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16151v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs) trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language. Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[GRPO-CARE: Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16141v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO, have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision. GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model) against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1, achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5% improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and robust MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released at: https://github.com/TencentARC/GRPO-CARE</p></details> |

Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues.</p></details> |  |

We investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However, structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work. Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient integrity across dynamic scientific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>91 pa...</summary><p>91 pages, 0 figures, includes mathematical appendix and formal proofs.

| **[LazyEviction: Lagged KV Eviction with Attention Pattern Observation for Efficient Long Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15969v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
