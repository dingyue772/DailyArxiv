| **[Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-RRM: Advancing Omni Reward Modeling via Automatic Rubric-Grounded Preference Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00846v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet their performance is often capped by the coarse nature of existing alignment techniques. A critical bottleneck remains the lack of effective reward models (RMs): existing RMs are predominantly vision-centric, return opaque scalar scores, and rely on costly human annotations. We introduce \textbf{Omni-RRM}, the first open-source rubric-grounded reward model that produces structured, multi-dimension preference judgments with dimension-wise justifications across \textbf{text, image, video, and audio}. At the core of our approach is \textbf{Omni-Preference}, a large-scale dataset built via a fully automated pipeline: we synthesize candidate response pairs by contrasting models of different capabilities, and use strong teacher models to \emph{reconcile and filter} preferences while providing a modality-aware \emph{rubric-grounded rationale} for each pair. This eliminates the need for human-labeled training preferences. Omni-RRM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning to learn the rubric-grounded outputs, followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) to sharpen discrimination on difficult, low-contrast pairs. Comprehensive evaluations show that Omni-RRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video (80.2\% on ShareGPT-V) and audio (66.8\% on Audio-HH-RLHF) benchmarks, and substantially outperforms existing open-source RMs on image tasks, with a 17.7\% absolute gain over its base model on overall accuracy. Omni-RRM also improves downstream performance via Best-of-$N$ selection and transfers to text-only preference benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Omni-RRM-CC08.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-fMRI: A Universal Atlas-Free fMRI Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23090v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised fMRI foundation models have shown promising transfer performance, yet most rely on predefined region-level parcellations that discard fine-grained voxel information and introduce atlas-dependent biases. We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Omni: A Unified Autoregressive Model for Any-to-Any Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17761v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-directional attention mechanism based on Mamba for speech separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16603v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a selective state-space model (SSM), has emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformers for speech modeling, enabling long-sequence processing with linear complexity. While effective in speech separation, existing approaches, whether in the time or time-frequency domain, typically decompose the input along a single dimension into short one-dimensional sequences before processing them with Mamba, which restricts it to local 1D modeling and limits its ability to capture global dependencies across the 2D spectrogram. In this work, we propose an efficient omni-directional attention (OA) mechanism built upon unidirectional Mamba, which models global dependencies from ten different directions on the spectrogram. We expand the proposed mechanism into two baseline separation models and evaluate on three public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach consistently achieves significant performance gains over the baselines while preserving linear complexity, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FutureOmni: Evaluating Future Forecasting from Omni-Modal Context for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13836v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong omni-modal perception, their ability to forecast future events from audio-visual cues remains largely unexplored, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on retrospective understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni).</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openmoss.github.io/FutureOmni</p></details> |
| **[AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10513v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROMA: Real-time Omni-Multimodal Assistant with Interactive Streaming Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10323v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page is available at https://eureka-maggie.github.io/ROMA_show</p></details> |
| **[Omni-R1: Towards the Unified Generative Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09536v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech-Hands: A Self-Reflection Voice Agentic Approach to Speech Recognition and Audio Reasoning with Omni Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09413v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a voice-agentic framework that learns one critical omni-understanding skill: knowing when to trust itself versus when to consult external audio perception. Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets. By unifying perception and decision-making, our work offers a practical path toward more reliable and resilient audio intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[e5-omni: Explicit Cross-modal Alignment for Omni-modal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03666v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B</p></details> |
| **[HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01792v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni, the first any-to-any omnimodal model in the HyperCLOVA X family that supports text, audio, and vision as both inputs and outputs. By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Omni-Weather: Unified Multimodal Foundation Model for Weather Generation and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21643v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather modeling requires both accurate prediction and mechanistic interpretation, yet existing methods treat these goals in isolation, separating generation from understanding. To address this gap, we present Omni-Weather, the first multimodal foundation model that unifies weather generation and understanding within a single architecture. Omni-Weather integrates a radar encoder for weather generation tasks, followed by unified processing using a shared self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset for causal reasoning in weather generation, enabling interpretable outputs and improved perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show Omni-Weather achieves state-of-the-art performance in both weather generation and understanding. Our findings further indicate that generative and understanding tasks in the weather domain can mutually enhance each other. Omni-Weather also demonstrates the feasibility and value of unifying weather generation and understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[UmniBench: Unified Understand and Generation Model Oriented Omni-dimensional Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17196v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://umnibench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SFBD-OMNI: Bridge models for lossy measurement restoration with limited clean samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17051v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal RewardBench 2: Evaluating Omni Reward Models for Interleaved Text and Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16899v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MMRB2</p></details> |
| **[Kling-Omni Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16776v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kling...</summary><p>Kling-Omni Technical Report</p></details> |

However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%.</p></details> | Submitted to TMM |

However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/omni-attribute</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Grounding Generated Videos in Feasible Plans via World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01960v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generative models have shown emerging capabilities as zero-shot visual planners, yet video-generated plans often violate temporal consistency and physical constraints, leading to failures when mapped to executable actions. To address this, we propose Grounding Video Plans with World Models (GVP-WM), a planning method that grounds video-generated plans into feasible action sequences using a learned action-conditioned world model. At test-time, GVP-WM first generates a video plan from initial and goal observations, then projects the video guidance onto the manifold of dynamically feasible latent trajectories via video-guided latent collocation. In particular, we formulate grounding as a goal-conditioned latent-space trajectory optimization problem that jointly optimizes latent states and actions under world-model dynamics, while preserving semantic alignment with the video-generated plan. Empirically, GVP-WM recovers feasible long-horizon plans from zero-shot image-to-video-generated and motion-blurred videos that violate physical constraints, across navigation and manipulation simulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review. 28 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[GPD: Guided Progressive Distillation for Fast and High-Quality Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01814v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in video generation; however, the high computational cost of the denoising process remains a major bottleneck. Existing approaches have shown promise in reducing the number of diffusion steps, but they often suffer from significant quality degradation when applied to video generation. We propose Guided Progressive Distillation (GPD), a framework that accelerates the diffusion process for fast and high-quality video generation. GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Autoregressive Video Diffusion and World Models with Temporal Cache Compression and Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01801v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dvirsamuel.github.io/fast-auto-regressive-video/</p></details> |

However, existing methods lack flexible adaptivity, leading to irreversible detail loss and context fragmentation. To resolve this, we propose FreshMem, a Frequency-Space Hybrid Memory network inspired by the brain's logarithmic perception and memory consolidation. FreshMem reconciles short-term fidelity with long-term coherence through two synergistic modules: Multi-scale Frequency Memory (MFM), which projects overflowing frames into representative frequency coefficients, complemented by residual details to reconstruct a global historical "gist"; and Space Thumbnail Memory (STM), which discretizes the continuous stream into episodic clusters by employing an adaptive compression strategy to distill them into high-density space thumbnails. Extensive experiments show that FreshMem significantly boosts the Qwen2-VL baseline, yielding gains of 5.20%, 4.52%, and 2.34% on StreamingBench, OV-Bench, and OVO-Bench, respectively. As a training-free solution, FreshMem outperforms several fully fine-tuned methods, offering a highly efficient paradigm for long-horizon streaming video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contribution-aware Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01649v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the redundancy of video tokens introduces significant computational overhead during inference, limiting their practical deployment. Many compression algorithms are proposed to prioritize retaining features with the highest attention scores to minimize perturbations in attention computations. However, the correlation between attention scores and their actual contribution to correct answers remains ambiguous. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontribution-\textbf{a}ware token \textbf{Co}mpression algorithm for \textbf{VID}eo understanding (\textbf{CaCoVID}) that explicitly optimizes the token selection policy based on the contribution of tokens to correct predictions. First, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework that optimizes a policy network to select video token combinations with the greatest contribution to correct predictions. This paradigm shifts the focus from passive token preservation to active discovery of optimal compressed token combinations. Secondly, we propose a combinatorial policy optimization algorithm with online combination space sampling, which dramatically reduces the exploration space for video token combinations and accelerates the convergence speed of policy optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of CaCoVID. Codes will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI2026</p></details> |

Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing attack methods often treat MoE as a unified architecture, overlooking the independent and collaborative weaknesses of key components such as routers and expert modules. To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles' Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models. It consistently enhances adversarial robustness across diverse datasets and architectures, effectively mitigating both the independent and collaborative weaknesses of MoE.</p></details> |  |

We conducted a study with 195 participants between the ages of 21 and 40, who judged real and deepfake videos, rated their confidence, and reported the cues they relied on across visual, audio, and knowledge strategies. Participants were more accurate with real videos than with deepfakes and showed lower expected calibration error for real content. Through association rule mining, we identified cue combinations that shaped performance. Visual appearance, vocal, and intuition often co-occurred for successful identifications, which highlights the importance of multimodal approaches in human detection. Our findings show which cues help or hinder detection and suggest directions for designing media literacy tools that guide effective cue use. Building on these insights can help people improve their identification skills and become more resilient to deceptive digital media.</p></details> |  |

Despite growing interest in AI agents for augmented reality (AR) assistance, progress remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale multimodal conversational datasets grounded in real-world task execution, in part due to the cost and logistical complexity of human-assisted data collection. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically transform single person instructional videos into two-person multimodal task-guidance conversations. Our fully automatic pipeline, based on large language models, provides a scalable and cost efficient alternative to traditional data collection approaches. Using this framework, we introduce HowToDIV, a multimodal dataset comprising 507 conversations, 6,636 question answer pairs, and 24 hours of video spanning multiple domains. Each session consists of a multi-turn expert-novice interaction. Finally, we report baseline results using Gemma 3 and Qwen 2.5 on HowToDIV, providing an initial benchmark for multimodal procedural task assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRVAU-R1: Enhancing Video Anomaly Understanding via Reflection-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01004v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in reasoning capabilities and shown promising effectiveness in video anomaly understanding (VAU) tasks. However, existing MLLM-based approaches remain largely focused on surface-level descriptions of anomalies, lacking deep reasoning over abnormal behaviors like explicit self-reflection and self-correction. To address that, we propose Self-Reflection-Enhanced Reasoning for Video Anomaly Understanding (SRVAU-R1), a reflection-aware learning framework that incorporates reflection in MLLM reasoning. Specifically, SRVAU-R1 introduces the first reflection-oriented Chain-of-Thought dataset tailored for VAU, providing structured supervision with initial reasoning, self-reflection, and revised reasoning. Based on that, it includes a novel reflection-aware learning paradigm with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance multi-modal reasoning for VAU. Extensive experiments on multiple video anomaly benchmarks demonstrate that SRVAU-R1 consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in both temporal anomaly localization accuracy and reasoning quality.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the limitations of existing methods, the work presents a five-fold contribution: (1) an automatic annotation framework that utilizes large vision-language models and a noise-robust contrastive learning objective with a subtractive angular margin; (2) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy using "recurrent adapters" to capture temporal dynamics in low-data regimes; (3) the integration of State Space Layers (SSL) for efficient long-form video modeling, supported by the introduction of two new long-term benchmarks for egocentric and feature-length content; (4) a novel contrastive learning framework designed to explicitly model fine-grained relations between motions and video moments; and (5) a comprehensive empirical study on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that identifies the visual-language interface as a bottleneck for temporal reasoning, leading to a new "temporal-oriented recipe" for upscaled video understanding. Collectively, these contributions demonstrate that explicit temporal modeling significantly enhances a model's ability to represent and reason about the fluid nature of video content.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, NUS, 2025</p></details> |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain largely designed for human-recorded videos or single-speaker settings. As a result, potential errors that occur in generated multi-talker dialogue videos, such as identity drift, unnatural turn transitions, and audio-visual misalignment, cannot be effectively captured and analyzed. To address this issue, we introduce MTAVG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating audio-visual multi-speaker dialogue generation. MTAVG-Bench is built via a semi-automatic pipeline, where 1.8k videos are generated using multiple popular models with carefully designed prompts, yielding 2.4k manually annotated QA pairs. The benchmark evaluates multi-speaker dialogue generation at four levels: audio-visual signal fidelity, temporal attribute consistency, social interaction, and cinematic expression. We benchmark 12 proprietary and open-source omni-models on MTAVG-Bench, with Gemini 3 Pro achieving the strongest overall performance, while leading open-source models remain competitive in signal fidelity and consistency. Overall, MTAVG-Bench enables fine-grained failure analysis for rigorous model comparison and targeted video generation refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Decode Against Compositional Hallucination in Video Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00559v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on video hallucination mitigation primarily focuses on isolated error types, leaving compositional hallucinations, arising from incorrect reasoning over multiple interacting spatial and temporal factors largely underexplored. We introduce OmniVCHall, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate both isolated and compositional hallucinations in video multimodal large language models (VLLMs). OmniVCHall spans diverse video domains, introduces a novel camera-based hallucination type, and defines a fine-grained taxonomy, together with adversarial answer options (e.g., "All are correct" and "None of the above") to prevent shortcut reasoning. The evaluations of 39 representative VLLMs reveal that even advanced models (e.g., Qwen3-VL and GPT-5) exhibit substantial performance degradation. We propose TriCD, a contrastive decoding framework with a triple-pathway calibration mechanism. An adaptive perturbation controller dynamically selects distracting operations to construct negative video variants, while a saliency-guided enhancement module adaptively reinforces grounded token-wise visual evidences. These components are optimized via reinforcement learning to encourage precise decision-making under compositional hallucination settings. Experimental results show that TriCD consistently improves performance across two representative backbones, achieving an average accuracy improvement of over 10%. The data and code can be find at https://github.com/BMRETURN/OmniVCHall.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring datasets that comprehensively cover diverse tasks and environments is extremely costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, human demonstration videos offer a rich and scalable source of diverse scenes and manipulation behaviors, yet their lack of explicit action supervision hinders direct utilization. Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning.</p></details> |  |

In pursuit of greater video compression efficiency, the AVS video coding working group launched the standardization exploration of end-to-end intelligent video coding, establishing the AVS End-to-End Intelligent Video Coding Exploration Model (AVS-EEM) project. A core design principle of AVS-EEM is its focus on practical deployment, featuring inherently low computational complexity and requiring strict adherence to the common test conditions of conventional video coding. This paper details the development history of AVS-EEM and provides a systematic introduction to its key technical framework, covering model architectures, training strategies, and inference optimizations. These innovations have collectively driven the project's rapid performance evolution, enabling continuous and significant gains under strict complexity constraints. Through over two years of iterative refinement and collaborative effort, the coding performance of AVS-EEM has seen substantial improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that its latest model achieves superior compression efficiency compared to the conventional AVS3 reference software, marking a significant step toward a deployable intelligent video coding standard.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeBlind: A Spatio-Temporal Compositionality Benchmark for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00288v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding. Dataset and code are available at https://baiqi-li.github.io/timeblind_project/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>For c...</summary><p>For code and data, see https://baiqi-li.github.io/timeblind_project/</p></details> |
| **[TokenTrim: Inference-Time Token Pruning for Autoregressive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00268v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive video generation enables long video synthesis by iteratively conditioning each new batch of frames on previously generated content. However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLACID: Identity-Preserving Multi-Object Compositing via Video Diffusion with Synthetic Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00267v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved photorealistic image synthesis, yet they fall short for studio-level multi-object compositing. This task demands simultaneous (i) near-perfect preservation of each item's identity, (ii) precise background and color fidelity, (iii) layout and design elements control, and (iv) complete, appealing displays showcasing all objects. However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image. Extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that PLACID surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-object compositing, achieving superior identity, background, and color preservation, with less omitted objects and visually appealing results.</p></details> |  |
