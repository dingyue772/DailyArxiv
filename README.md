| **[R1-Reward: Training Multimodal Reward Model Through Stable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02835v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While recent advancements have primarily focused on improving the model structure and training data of MRMs, there has been limited exploration into the effectiveness of long-term reasoning capabilities for reward modeling and how to activate these capabilities in MRMs. In this paper, we explore how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to improve reward modeling. Specifically, we reformulate the reward modeling problem as a rule-based RL task. However, we observe that directly applying existing RL algorithms, such as Reinforce++, to reward modeling often leads to training instability or even collapse due to the inherent limitations of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose the StableReinforce algorithm, which refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods. These refinements result in more stable training dynamics and superior performance. To facilitate MRM training, we collect 200K preference data from diverse datasets. Our reward model, R1-Reward, trained using the StableReinforce algorithm on this dataset, significantly improves performance on multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. Compared to previous SOTA models, R1-Reward achieves a $8.4\%$ improvement on the VL Reward-Bench and a $14.3\%$ improvement on the Multimodal Reward Bench. Moreover, with more inference compute, R1-Reward's performance is further enhanced, highlighting the potential of RL algorithms in optimizing MRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Home ...</summary><p>Home page: https://github.com/yfzhang114/r1_reward</p></details> |
| **[Sailing AI by the Stars: A Survey of Learning from Rewards in Post-Training and Test-Time Scaling of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02686v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from pre-training scaling to post-training and test-time scaling. Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (in RLHF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the paradigm of learning from rewards. We categorize and analyze the strategies under this paradigm across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges and future directions. We maintain a paper collection at https://github.com/bobxwu/learning-from-rewards-llm-papers.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[A Survey on Progress in LLM Alignment from the Perspective of Reward Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02666v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions represents a core challenge in current AI research, where reward mechanism design has become a critical factor in shaping model behavior. This study conducts a comprehensive investigation of reward mechanisms in LLM alignment through a systematic theoretical framework, categorizing their development into three key phases: (1) feedback (diagnosis), (2) reward design (prescription), and (3) optimization (treatment). Through a four-dimensional analysis encompassing construction basis, format, expression, and granularity, this research establishes a systematic classification framework that reveals evolutionary trends in reward modeling. The field of LLM alignment faces several persistent challenges, while recent advances in reward design are driving significant paradigm shifts. Notable developments include the transition from reinforcement learning-based frameworks to novel optimization paradigms, as well as enhanced capabilities to address complex alignment scenarios involving multimodal integration and concurrent task coordination. Finally, this survey outlines promising future research directions for LLM alignment through innovative reward design strategies.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Survey of Slow Thinking-based Reasoning LLMs using Reinforced Learning and Inference-time Scaling Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02665v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Coupled Distributional Random Expert Distillation for World Model Online Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02228v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation (RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl, Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over adversarial methods while maintaining expert-level performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Projection-based Reward Integration for Scene-Aware Real-to-Sim-to-Real Transfer with Few Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20520v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from few demonstrations to develop policies robust to variations in robot initial positions and object poses is a problem of significant practical interest in robotics. Compared to imitation learning, which often struggles to generalize from limited samples, reinforcement learning (RL) can autonomously explore to obtain robust behaviors. Training RL agents through direct interaction with the real world is often impractical and unsafe, while building simulation environments requires extensive manual effort, such as designing scenes and crafting task-specific reward functions. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that constructs simulation environments based on expert demonstrations by identifying scene objects from images and retrieving their corresponding 3D models from existing libraries. We introduce a projection-based reward model for RL policy training that is supervised by a vision-language model (VLM) using human-guided object projection relationships as prompts, with the policy further fine-tuned using expert demonstrations. In general, our work focuses on the construction of simulation environments and RL-based policy training, ultimately enabling the deployment of reliable robotic control policies in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-Based Interaction For Conversation Recommendation via Generative Reward Model Based Simulated User](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20458v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational recommendation systems (CRSs) use multi-turn interaction to capture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. A fundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user preferences from conversations. User preferences can be multifaceted and complex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with access to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify their true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user experience. To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated user, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user provides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better capture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by generative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the simulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained feedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained feedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified into an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified simulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated user, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted. Furthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw inspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning tasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we propose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation results derived from interaction. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and transferability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Toward Evaluative Thinking: Meta Policy Optimization with Evolving Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20157v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward-based alignment methods for large language models (LLMs) face two key limitations: vulnerability to reward hacking, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal; and reliance on brittle, labor-intensive prompt engineering when LLMs are used as reward models. We introduce Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a framework that addresses these challenges by integrating a meta-reward model that dynamically refines the reward model's prompt throughout training. In MPO, the meta-reward model monitors the evolving training context and continuously adjusts the reward model's prompt to maintain high alignment, providing an adaptive reward signal that resists exploitation by the policy. This meta-learning approach promotes a more stable policy optimization, and greatly reduces the need for manual reward prompt design. It yields performance on par with or better than models guided by extensively hand-crafted reward prompts. Furthermore, we show that MPO maintains its effectiveness across diverse tasks, such as question answering and mathematical reasoning, without requiring specialized reward designs. Beyond standard RLAIF, MPO's meta-learning formulation is readily extensible to higher-level alignment frameworks. Overall, this method addresses theoretical and practical challenges in reward-based RL alignment for LLMs, paving the way for more robust and adaptable alignment strategies. The code and models will be publicly shared.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Diverse LLM Mathematical Reasoning via Automated PRM-Guided GFlowNets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19981v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anyprefer: An Agentic Framework for Preference Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19276v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer significantly improves model alignment performance across four main applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and 16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Web GUI Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19237v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated GUI testing of web applications has always been considered a challenging task considering their large state space and complex interaction logic. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a recent extension of Reinforcement Learning (RL), which takes advantage of the powerful learning capabilities of neural networks, making it suitable for complex exploration space. In this paper, leveraging the capability of deep reinforcement learning, we propose WebRLED, an effective approach for automated GUI testing of complex web applications. WebRLED has the following characteristics: (1) a grid-based action value learning technique, which can improve the efficiency of state space exploration; (2) a novel action discriminator which can be trained during the exploration to identify more actions; (3) an adaptive, curiosity-driven reward model, which considers the novelty of an explored state within an episode and global history, and can guide exploration continuously. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of WebRLED on 12 open-source web applications and a field study of the top 50 most popular web applications in the world. The experimental results show that WebRLED achieves higher code/state coverage and failure detection rate compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Furthermore, WebRLED finds 695 unique failures in 50 real-world applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19162v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming state-of-the-art process reward models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://chen-judge.github.io/SPC/</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Multi-Round Enhanced Training in Diffusion Models for Improved Preference Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18204v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has significantly changed industries by enabling text-driven image generation, yet challenges remain in achieving high-resolution outputs that align with fine-grained user preferences. Consequently, multi-round interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations. Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation (VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions, such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.17660</p></details> |
| **[Process Reward Models That Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16828v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models will be released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skywork R1V2: Multimodal Hybrid Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16656v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we introduce the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively counters the ``Vanishing Advantages'' dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini. The Skywork R1V2 model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-R1V2-38B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Explainable Dense Reward Shapes via Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16272v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipelines for large language model (LLM) alignment typically assign scalar rewards to sequences, using the final token as a surrogate indicator for the quality of the entire sequence. However, this leads to sparse feedback and suboptimal token-level credit assignment. In this work, we frame reward shaping as an optimization problem focused on token-level credit assignment. We propose a reward-shaping function leveraging explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME to estimate per-token rewards from the reward model. To learn parameters of this shaping function, we employ a bilevel optimization framework that integrates Bayesian Optimization and policy training to handle noise from the token reward estimates. Our experiments show that achieving a better balance of token-level reward attribution leads to performance improvements over baselines on downstream tasks and finds an optimal policy faster during training. Furthermore, we show theoretically that explainability methods that are feature additive attribution functions maintain the optimal policy as the original reward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding VLM Agents with Process Rewards at Inference Time for GUI Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16073v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in visual language models (VLMs) have notably enhanced their capabilities in handling complex Graphical User Interface (GUI) interaction tasks. Despite these improvements, current frameworks often struggle to generate correct actions in challenging GUI environments. State-of-the-art commercial VLMs are black-boxes, and fine-tuning open-source VLMs for GUI tasks requires significant resources. Additionally, existing trajectory-level evaluation and refinement techniques frequently fall short due to delayed feedback and local optimization issues. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that guides VLM agents with process supervision by a reward model during GUI navigation and control at inference time. This guidance allows the VLM agent to optimize actions at each inference step, thereby improving performance in both static and dynamic environments. In particular, our method demonstrates significant performance gains in three GUI navigation tasks, achieving a 3.4% improvement in single step action accuracy for static environments, along with a around 33% increase in task success rate in one dynamic environment. With further integration of trajectory reflection and retry mechanisms, we also demonstrate even greater enhancement in task success.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-DPO: Improving Data Utilization in Direct Preference Optimization Using a Guiding Reference Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15843v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stop Summation: Min-Form Credit Assignment Is All Process Reward Model Needs for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15275v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have enabled automated CXR interpretation, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, despite their strong visual understanding, current Medical LMMs (MLMMs) still face two major challenges: (1) Insufficient region-level understanding and interaction, and (2) Limited accuracy and interpretability due to single-step reasoning. In this paper, we empower MLMMs with anatomy-centric reasoning capabilities to enhance their interactivity and explainability. Specifically, we first propose an Anatomical Ontology-Guided Reasoning (AOR) framework, which centers on cross-modal region-level information to facilitate multi-step reasoning. Next, under the guidance of expert physicians, we develop AOR-Instruction, a large instruction dataset for MLMMs training. Our experiments demonstrate AOR's superior performance in both VQA and report generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report v1 (33 pages, 8 figures, project page: https://sphere-ai-lab.github.io/FormalMATH/)</p></details> |

This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Slow Thinking-based Reasoning LLMs using Reinforced Learning and Inference-time Scaling Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02665v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey explores recent advancements in reasoning large language models (LLMs) designed to mimic "slow thinking" - a reasoning process inspired by human cognition, as described in Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. These models, like OpenAI's o1, focus on scaling computational resources dynamically during complex tasks, such as math reasoning, visual reasoning, medical diagnosis, and multi-agent debates. We present the development of reasoning LLMs and list their key technologies. By synthesizing over 100 studies, it charts a path toward LLMs that combine human-like deep thinking with scalable efficiency for reasoning. The review breaks down methods into three categories: (1) test-time scaling dynamically adjusts computation based on task complexity via search and sampling, dynamic verification; (2) reinforced learning refines decision-making through iterative improvement leveraging policy networks, reward models, and self-evolution strategies; and (3) slow-thinking frameworks (e.g., long CoT, hierarchical processes) that structure problem-solving with manageable steps. The survey highlights the challenges and further directions of this domain. Understanding and advancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs is crucial for unlocking their full potential in real-world applications, from scientific discovery to decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies for Generic Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02576v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore, RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also being more computationally efficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02391v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[HyperTree Planning: Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Hierarchical Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02322v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in tackling complex reasoning tasks, achieving notable success in domains like mathematical and logical reasoning. However, these methods encounter challenges with complex planning tasks, primarily due to extended reasoning steps, diverse constraints, and the challenge of handling multiple distinct sub-tasks. To address these challenges, we propose HyperTree Planning (HTP), a novel reasoning paradigm that constructs hypertree-structured planning outlines for effective planning. The hypertree structure enables LLMs to engage in hierarchical thinking by flexibly employing the divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively breaking down intricate reasoning steps, accommodating diverse constraints, and managing multiple distinct sub-tasks in a well-organized manner. We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the TravelPlanner benchmark with Gemini-1.5-Pro, resulting in a 3.6 times performance improvement over o1-preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.14228 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[VECSR: Virtually Embodied Common Sense Reasoning System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02144v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous agents has seen a revival of enthusiasm due to the emergence of LLMs, such as GPT-4o. Deploying these agents in environments where they coexist with humans (e.g., as domestic assistants) requires special attention to trustworthiness and explainability. However, the use of LLMs and other deep learning models still does not resolve these key issues. Deep learning systems may hallucinate, be unable to justify their decisions as black boxes, or perform badly on unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose the use of s(CASP), a goal-directed common sense reasoner based on Answer Set Programming, to break down the high-level tasks of an autonomous agent into mid-level instructions while justifying the selection of these instructions. To validate its use in real applications we present a framework that integrates the reasoner into the VirtualHome simulator and compares its accuracy with GPT-4o, running some of the real use cases available in the domestic environments of VirtualHome. Additionally, since experiments with VirtualHome have shown the need to reduce the response time (which increases as the agent's decision space grows), we have proposed and evaluated a series of optimizations based on program analysis that exploit the advantages of the top-down execution of s(CASP).</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Potential of Offline RL for Reasoning in LLMs: A Preliminary Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02142v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in long-context reasoning by large language models (LLMs), primarily through Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, these approaches incur substantial computational costs and complexity. In contrast, simpler and more economical Offline RL methods remain underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate the effectiveness of Offline RL methods, specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its length-desensitized variant LD-DPO, in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that these simpler Offline RL methods substantially improve model performance, achieving an average enhancement of 3.3\%, with a particularly notable increase of 10.1\% on the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity to output length, emphasizing that increasing reasoning length should align with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing and training methodologies, offering empirical evidence and practical insights for developing more cost-effective Offline RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveAgent: Multi-Agent Structured Reasoning with LLM and Multimodal Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02123v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DriveAgent, a novel multi-agent autonomous driving framework that leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning combined with multimodal sensor fusion to enhance situational understanding and decision-making. DriveAgent uniquely integrates diverse sensor modalities-including camera, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU-with LLM-driven analytical processes structured across specialized agents. The framework operates through a modular agent-based pipeline comprising four principal modules: (i) a descriptive analysis agent identifying critical sensor data events based on filtered timestamps, (ii) dedicated vehicle-level analysis conducted by LiDAR and vision agents that collaboratively assess vehicle conditions and movements, (iii) environmental reasoning and causal analysis agents explaining contextual changes and their underlying mechanisms, and (iv) an urgency-aware decision-generation agent prioritizing insights and proposing timely maneuvers. This modular design empowers the LLM to effectively coordinate specialized perception and reasoning agents, delivering cohesive, interpretable insights into complex autonomous driving scenarios. Extensive experiments on challenging autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that DriveAgent is achieving superior performance on multiple metrics against baseline methods. These results validate the efficacy of the proposed LLM-driven multi-agent sensor fusion framework, underscoring its potential to substantially enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RTV-Bench: Benchmarking MLLM Continuous Perception, Understanding and Reasoning through Real-Time Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02064v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception, understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552 diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline (Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5, InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance, sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available at: https://github.com/LJungang/RTV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[R-Bench: Graduate-level Multi-disciplinary Benchmarks for LLM & MLLM Complex Reasoning Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02018v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning stands as a cornerstone of intelligence, enabling the synthesis of existing knowledge to solve complex problems. Despite remarkable progress, existing reasoning benchmarks often fail to rigorously evaluate the nuanced reasoning capabilities required for complex, real-world problemsolving, particularly in multi-disciplinary and multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce a graduate-level, multi-disciplinary, EnglishChinese benchmark, dubbed as Reasoning Bench (R-Bench), for assessing the reasoning capability of both language and multimodal models. RBench spans 1,094 questions across 108 subjects for language model evaluation and 665 questions across 83 subjects for multimodal model testing in both English and Chinese. These questions are meticulously curated to ensure rigorous difficulty calibration, subject balance, and crosslinguistic alignment, enabling the assessment to be an Olympiad-level multi-disciplinary benchmark. We evaluate widely used models, including OpenAI o1, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, etc. Experimental results indicate that advanced models perform poorly on complex reasoning, especially multimodal reasoning. Even the top-performing model OpenAI o1 achieves only 53.2% accuracy on our multimodal evaluation. Data and code are made publicly available at here.</p></details> | 18pages |
| **[Structured Prompting and Feedback-Guided Reasoning with LLMs for Data Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01636v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output, and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.</p></details> | 21 pages, 2 figures |
| **[TEMPURA: Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01583v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal event relationships and achieving fine-grained temporal grounding in videos remain challenging for vision-language models. Existing methods either compress video tokens to reduce temporal resolution, or treat videos as unsegmented streams, which obscures fine-grained event boundaries and limits the modeling of causal dependencies. We propose TEMPURA (Temporal Event Masked Prediction and Understanding for Reasoning in Action), a two-stage training framework that enhances video temporal understanding. TEMPURA first applies masked event prediction reasoning to reconstruct missing events and generate step-by-step causal explanations from dense event annotations, drawing inspiration from effective infilling techniques. TEMPURA then learns to perform video segmentation and dense captioning to decompose videos into non-overlapping events with detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. We train TEMPURA on VER, a large-scale dataset curated by us that comprises 1M training instances and 500K videos with temporally aligned event descriptions and structured reasoning steps. Experiments on temporal grounding and highlight detection benchmarks demonstrate that TEMPURA outperforms strong baseline models, confirming that integrating causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation leads to improved video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameterized Argumentation-based Reasoning Tasks for Benchmarking Generative Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01539v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle. Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing responsible AI systems in the legal domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation as a short paper at the 20th International Conference of AI & Law in Chicago, June 16 to 20 of 2025</p></details> |
| **[WorldGenBench: A World-Knowledge-Integrated Benchmark for Reasoning-Driven Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01490v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive results, yet existing models still struggle with prompts that require rich world knowledge and implicit reasoning: both of which are critical for producing semantically accurate, coherent, and contextually appropriate images in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{WorldGenBench}, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate T2I models' world knowledge grounding and implicit inferential capabilities, covering both the humanities and nature domains. We propose the \textbf{Knowledge Checklist Score}, a structured metric that measures how well generated images satisfy key semantic expectations. Experiments across 21 state-of-the-art models reveal that while diffusion models lead among open-source methods, proprietary auto-regressive models like GPT-4o exhibit significantly stronger reasoning and knowledge integration. Our findings highlight the need for deeper understanding and inference capabilities in next-generation T2I systems.

| **[Understanding LLM Scientific Reasoning through Promptings and Model's Explanation on the Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01482v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving across various domains. However, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning task-essential for applications in science, medicine, and law-remains an area of active investigation. This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. The study uses prompt engineering techniques on the Graduate-Level GoogleProof Q&A (GPQA) dataset to assess the scientific reasoning of GPT-4o. Five popular prompt engineering techniques and two tailored promptings were tested: baseline direct answer (zero-shot), chain-of-thought (CoT), zero-shot CoT, self-ask, self-consistency, decomposition, and multipath promptings. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit emergent reasoning abilities, they often rely on pattern recognition rather than true logical inference, leading to inconsistencies in complex problem-solving. The results indicated that self-consistency outperformed the other prompt engineering technique with an accuracy of 52.99%, followed by direct answer (52.23%). Zero-shot CoT (50%) outperformed multipath (48.44%), decomposition (47.77%), self-ask (46.88%), and CoT (43.75%). Self-consistency performed the second worst in explaining the answers. Simple techniques such as direct answer, CoT, and zero-shot CoT have the best scientific reasoning. We propose a research agenda aimed at bridging these gaps by integrating structured reasoning frameworks, hybrid AI approaches, and human-in-the-loop methodologies. By critically evaluating the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on the future of artificial general intelligence and the development of more robust, trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRAVELER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Reasoning across Vague, Implicit and Explicit References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01325v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and resolving temporal references is essential in Natural Language Understanding as we often refer to the past or future in daily communication. Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/s.kenneweg/TRAVELER</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Springer Nature Computer Science</p></details> |

However, analyzing these signals remains challenging: traditional methods rely on handcrafted features or supervised deep learning models that demand extensive labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and applicability. To address these issues, we propose CaReAQA, an audio-language model that integrates a foundation audio model with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling clinically relevant, open-ended diagnostic responses. Alongside CaReAQA, we introduce CaReSound, a benchmark dataset of annotated medical audio recordings enriched with metadata and paired question-answer examples, intended to drive progress in diagnostic reasoning research. Evaluation results show that CaReAQA achieves 86.2% accuracy on open-ended diagnostic reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models. It also generalizes well to closed-ended classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy of 56.9% on unseen datasets. Our findings show how audio-language integration and reasoning advances medical diagnostics, enabling efficient AI systems for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AHLI CHIL 2025</p></details> |
