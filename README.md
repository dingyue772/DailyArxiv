| **[LLM-based Agents Suffer from Hallucinations: A Survey of Taxonomy, Methods, and Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18970v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartHal: A Fine-grained Framework Evaluating Hallucination of Large Vision Language Models in Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17481v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress, yet hallucination remains a critical barrier, particularly in chart understanding, which requires sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities as well as rigorous factual accuracy. While prior work has investigated hallucinations and chart comprehension independently, their intersection remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for more robust mitigation strategies. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ymcui/ChartHal .</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Reformulation Entropy for Robust Hallucination Detection in QA Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17445v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable question answering with large language models (LLMs) is challenged by hallucinations, fluent but factually incorrect outputs arising from epistemic uncertainty. Existing entropy-based semantic-level uncertainty estimation methods are limited by sampling noise and unstable clustering of variable-length answers. We propose Semantic Reformulation Entropy (SRE), which improves uncertainty estimation in two ways. First, input-side semantic reformulations produce faithful paraphrases, expand the estimation space, and reduce biases from superficial decoder tendencies. Second, progressive, energy-based hybrid clustering stabilizes semantic grouping. Experiments on SQuAD and TriviaQA show that SRE outperforms strong baselines, providing more robust and generalizable hallucination detection. These results demonstrate that combining input diversification with multi-signal clustering substantially enhances semantic-level uncertainty estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5page...</summary><p>5pages, 5 figures, submit to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Financial RAG with Agentic AI and Multi-HyDE: A Novel Approach to Knowledge Retrieval and Hallucination Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16369v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable knowledge retrieval is vital for financial question-answering, where continually updated data sources and complex, high-stakes contexts demand precision. Traditional retrieval systems rely on a single database and retriever, but financial applications require more sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large, structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets, including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular, adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Tables, 2 Figures.

| **[How Large Language Models are Designed to Hallucinate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16297v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable fluency across linguistic and reasoning tasks but remain systematically prone to hallucination. Prevailing accounts attribute hallucinations to data gaps, limited context, or optimization errors. We argue instead that hallucination is a structural outcome of the transformer architecture. As coherence engines, transformers are compelled to produce fluent continuations, with self-attention simulating the relational structure of meaning but lacking the existential grounding of temporality, mood, and care that stabilizes human understanding. On this basis, we distinguish ontological hallucination, arising when continuations require disclosure of beings in world, and residual reasoning hallucination, where models mimic inference by recycling traces of human reasoning in text. We illustrate these patterns through case studies aligned with Heideggerian categories and an experiment across twelve LLMs showing how simulated "self-preservation" emerges under extended prompts. Our contribution is threefold: (1) a comparative account showing why existing explanations are insufficient; (2) a predictive taxonomy of hallucination linked to existential structures with proposed benchmarks; and (3) design directions toward "truth-constrained" architectures capable of withholding or deferring when disclosure is absent. We conclude that hallucination is not an incidental defect but a defining limit of transformer-based models, an outcome scaffolding can mask but never resolve.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[EigenTrack: Spectral Activation Feature Tracking for Hallucination and Out-of-Distribution Detection in LLMs and VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15735v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |
| **[ORCA: Agentic Reasoning For Hallucination and Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15435v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models (less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense, and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\% to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE, ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to +48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Driven Hallucination in Large Language Models: An Empirical Study on Process Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15336v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analytical tasks is rooted in their vast pre-trained knowledge, which allows them to interpret ambiguous inputs and infer missing information. However, this same capability introduces a critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon where the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is overridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper investigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated process modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model from a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM) provides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes follow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong pre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to create scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the LLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and deliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the provided evidence. Our work provides a methodology for assessing this critical reliability issue and raises awareness of the need for rigorous validation of AI-generated artifacts in any evidence-based domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>The V...</summary><p>The Version of Record of this contribution will be published in the proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Generative AI for Process Mining (GenAI4PM 2025).

| **[Diving into Mitigating Hallucinations from a Vision Perspective for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13836v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network. It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing hallucinations and improving overall model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Finding</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Uncertainty for Detecting and Correcting Hallucinations in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13813v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate impressive results across diverse tasks but are still known to hallucinate, generating linguistically plausible but incorrect answers to questions. Uncertainty quantification has been proposed as a strategy for hallucination detection, but no existing black-box approach provides estimates for both global and local uncertainty. The former attributes uncertainty to a batch of responses, while the latter attributes uncertainty to individual responses. Current local methods typically rely on white-box access to internal model states, whilst black-box methods only provide global uncertainty estimates. We introduce a geometric framework to address this, based on archetypal analysis of batches of responses sampled with only black-box model access. At the global level, we propose Geometric Volume, which measures the convex hull volume of archetypes derived from response embeddings. At the local level, we propose Geometric Suspicion, which ranks responses by reliability and enables hallucination reduction through preferential response selection. Unlike prior dispersion methods which yield only a single global score, our approach provides semantic boundary points which have utility for attributing reliability to individual responses. Experiments show that our framework performs comparably to or better than prior methods on short form question-answering datasets, and achieves superior results on medical datasets where hallucinations carry particularly critical risks. We also provide theoretical justification by proving a link between convex hull volume and entropy.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSCC-HS: A Dynamic Self-Reinforcing Framework for Hallucination Suppression in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13702v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) hallucination is a significant barrier to their reliable deployment. Current methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are often reactive. We introduce **Dynamic Self-reinforcing Calibration for Hallucination Suppression (DSCC-HS)**, a novel, proactive framework that intervenes during autoregressive decoding. Inspired by dual-process cognitive theory, DSCC-HS uses a compact proxy model, trained in adversarial roles as a Factual Alignment Proxy (FAP) and a Hallucination Detection Proxy (HDP). During inference, these proxies dynamically steer a large target model by injecting a real-time steering vector, which is the difference between FAP and HDP logits, at each decoding step. This plug-and-play approach requires no modification to the target model. Our experiments on TruthfulQA and BioGEN show DSCC-HS achieves state-of-the-art performance. On TruthfulQA, it reached a 99.2% Factual Consistency Rate (FCR). On the long-form BioGEN benchmark, it attained the highest FActScore of 46.50. These results validate DSCC-HS as a principled and efficient solution for enhancing LLM factuality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on Hidden Layer Temporal Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13154v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios. All our data and code are available at https://github.com/Eurekaleo/Dr.V.</p></details> | 25 pages, 16 figures |

This work addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1 score of 69% outperforming baseline detectors by 25.44%. Benchmarking five chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy (96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy. While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk domains, enhancing trust in LLM-driven assistants.

| **[D$^2$HScore: Reasoning-Aware Hallucination Detection via Semantic Breadth and Depth Analysis in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11569v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics. Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)}, a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1) \textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift}, which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[HARP: Hallucination Detection via Reasoning Subspace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11536v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original, filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by Self-Injecting Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11287v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/davidluciolu/APASI.</p></details> | emnlp 2025 accepted |
| **[Predictable Compression Failures: Why Language Models Actually Hallucinate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11208v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models perform near-Bayesian inference yet violate permutation invariance on exchangeable data. We resolve this by showing transformers minimize expected conditional description length (cross-entropy) over orderings, $\mathbb{E}_\pi[\ell(Y \mid \Gamma_\pi(X))]$, which admits a Kolmogorov-complexity interpretation up to additive constants, rather than the permutation-invariant description length $\ell(Y \mid X)$. This makes them Bayesian in expectation, not in realization. We derive (i) a Quantified Martingale Violation bound showing order-induced deviations scale as $O(\log n)$ with constants; (ii) the Expectation-level Decompression Law linking information budgets to reliability for Bernoulli predicates; and (iii) deployable planners (B2T/RoH/ISR) for answer/abstain decisions. Empirically, permutation dispersion follows $a+b\ln n$ (Qwen2-7B $b \approx 0.377$, Llama-3.1-8B $b \approx 0.147$); permutation mixtures improve ground-truth likelihood/accuracy; and randomized dose-response shows hallucinations drop by $\sim 0.13$ per additional nat. A pre-specified audit with a fixed ISR=1.0 achieves near-0\% hallucinations via calibrated refusal at 24\% abstention. The framework turns hallucinations into predictable compression failures and enables principled information budgeting.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Enhancement with Domain Expert Mental Model to Reduce LLM Hallucination with Causal Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10818v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Difficult decision-making problems abound in various disciplines and domains. The proliferation of generative techniques, especially large language models (LLMs), has excited interest in using them for decision support. However, LLMs cannot yet resolve missingness in their training data, leading to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external information retrieval, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy. Yet, RAG and related methods are only partial solutions, as they may lack access to all necessary sources or key missing information. Even everyday issues often challenge LLMs' abilities. Submitting longer prompts with context and examples is one approach to address knowledge gaps, but designing effective prompts is non-trivial and may not capture complex mental models of domain experts. For tasks with missing critical information, LLMs are insufficient, as are many existing systems poorly represented in available documents. This paper explores how LLMs can make decision-making more efficient, using a running example of evaluating whether to respond to a call for proposals. We propose a technology based on optimized human-machine dialogue and monotone Boolean and k-valued functions to discover a computationally tractable personal expert mental model (EMM) of decision-making. Our EMM algorithm for LLM prompt engineering has four steps: (1) factor identification, (2) hierarchical structuring of factors, (3) generating a generalized expert mental model specification, and (4) generating a detailed generalized expert mental model from that specification.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages,4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>A lig...</summary><p>A lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context</p></details> |

Simulators provide safe, scalable training environments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety concerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that differ from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques offer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable training pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular sim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often results in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refined Barrier Conditions for Finite-Time Safety and Reach-Avoid Guarantees in Stochastic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18518v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing finite-time probabilistic safety and reach-avoid guarantees is crucial for safety-critical stochastic systems. Existing barrier certificate methods often rely on a restrictive boundedness assumption for auxiliary functions, limiting their applicability. This paper presents refined barrier-like conditions that remove this assumption. Specifically, we establish conditions for deriving upper bounds on finite-time safety probabilities in discrete-time systems and lower bounds on finite-time reach-avoid probabilities in continuous-time systems. This key relaxation significantly expands the class of verifiable systems, especially those with unbounded state spaces, and facilitates the application of advanced optimization techniques, such as semi-definite programming with polynomial functions. The efficacy of our approach is validated through numerical examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Safety and Skill Reasoning of Large Reasoning Models Under Compute Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18382v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length, and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategic Dishonesty Can Undermine AI Safety Evaluations of Frontier LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18058v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest, helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that sound harmful but are crafted to be subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy. Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.</p></details> |  |
| **[DriveDPO: Policy Learning via Safety DPO For End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17940v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving has substantially progressed by directly predicting future trajectories from raw perception inputs, which bypasses traditional modular pipelines. However, mainstream methods trained via imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework. First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of 90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving behaviors.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[EigenSafe: A Spectral Framework for Learning-Based Stochastic Safety Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17750v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present EigenSafe, an operator-theoretic framework for learning-enabled safety-critical control for stochastic systems. In many robotic systems where dynamics are best modeled as stochastic systems due to factors such as sensing noise and environmental disturbances, it is challenging for conventional methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi reachability and control barrier functions to provide a holistic measure of safety. We derive a linear operator governing the dynamic programming principle for safety probability, and find that its dominant eigenpair provides information about safety for both individual states and the overall closed-loop system. The proposed learning framework, called EigenSafe, jointly learns this dominant eigenpair and a safe backup policy in an offline manner. The learned eigenfunction is then used to construct a safety filter that detects potentially unsafe situations and falls back to the backup policy. The framework is validated in three simulated stochastic safety-critical control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Safe and Robust Robot Learning for Operation in the Real World (SAFE-ROL) at CoRL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distributionally Robust Safety Verification of Neural Networks via Worst-Case CVaR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17413v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP) framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk (WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk. This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids, polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The SAGES Critical View of Safety Challenge: A Global Benchmark for AI-Assisted Surgical Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17100v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for surgical quality assessment promise to democratize access to expertise, with applications in training, guidance, and accreditation. This study presents the SAGES Critical View of Safety (CVS) Challenge, the first AI competition organized by a surgical society, using the CVS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a universally recommended yet inconsistently performed safety step, as an exemplar of surgical quality assessment. A global collaboration across 54 institutions in 24 countries engaged hundreds of clinicians and engineers to curate 1,000 videos annotated by 20 surgical experts according to a consensus-validated protocol. The challenge addressed key barriers to real-world deployment in surgery, including achieving high performance, capturing uncertainty in subjective assessment, and ensuring robustness to clinical variability. To enable this scale of effort, we developed EndoGlacier, a framework for managing large, heterogeneous surgical video and multi-annotator workflows. Thirteen international teams participated, achieving up to a 17\% relative gain in assessment performance, over 80\% reduction in calibration error, and a 17\% relative improvement in robustness over the state-of-the-art. Analysis of results highlighted methodological trends linked to model performance, providing guidance for future research toward robust, clinically deployable AI for surgical quality assessment.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Advancing Accessible Hand-Arm Vibration Safety Monitoring: ISO-Compliance with Wearable Sensors and Transfer Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16536v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field workers are frequently exposed to hazardous vibrations, increasing the risk of Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) and other long-term health problems. ISO 5349-1 provides guidelines for measuring vibration exposure. However, this standard was established in controlled conditions using high-quality accelerometers directly attached to power tool handles. This study investigates an alternative, wearable sensor-based data collection process and develops an error-minimization transfer function that derives values comparable to ISO benchmarks for safety monitoring. Experiments are performed with subjects hammer drilling into concrete while vibrations are measured using three accelerometers at different sampling frequencies. The transfer function maps vibration data across sensor positions by accounting for damping effects. The findings indicate a significant reduction in acceleration between the palm and upper arm, highlight the impact of sampling frequency on data accuracy, and enable accurate comparison of true hand-arm vibration levels with existing standard limits to allow accessible, real-time, and cost-effective HAVS prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Constitutional AI: Enhancing Safety in LLM-Powered Mental Health Chatbots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16444v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances, general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges, including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiteRSan: Lightweight Memory Safety Via Rust-specific Program Analysis and Selective Instrumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16389v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust is a memory-safe language, and its strong safety guarantees combined with high performance have been attracting widespread adoption in systems programming and security-critical applications. However, Rust permits the use of unsafe code, which bypasses compiler-enforced safety checks and can introduce memory vulnerabilities. A widely adopted approach for detecting memory safety bugs in Rust is Address Sanitizer (ASan). Optimized versions, such as ERASan and RustSan, have been proposed to selectively apply security checks in order to reduce performance overhead. However, these tools still incur significant performance and memory overhead and fail to detect many classes of memory safety vulnerabilities due to the inherent limitations of ASan. In this paper, we present LiteRSan, a novel memory safety sanitizer that addresses the limitations of prior approaches. By leveraging Rust's unique ownership model, LiteRSan performs Rust-specific static analysis that is aware of pointer lifetimes to identify risky pointers. It then selectively instruments risky pointers to enforce only the necessary spatial or temporal memory safety checks. Consequently, LiteRSan introduces significantly lower runtime overhead (18.84% versus 152.05% and 183.50%) and negligible memory overhead (0.81% versus 739.27% and 861.98%) compared with existing ASan-based sanitizers while being capable of detecting memory safety bugs that prior techniques miss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (main text), 18 pages including references and appendix, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Psychometric Personality Shaping Modulates Capabilities and Safety in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16332v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models increasingly mediate high-stakes interactions, intensifying research on their capabilities and safety. While recent work has shown that LLMs exhibit consistent and measurable synthetic personality traits, little is known about how modulating these traits affects model behavior. We address this gap by investigating how psychometric personality control grounded in the Big Five framework influences AI behavior in the context of capability and safety benchmarks. Our experiments reveal striking effects: for example, reducing conscientiousness leads to significant drops in safety-relevant metrics on benchmarks such as WMDP, TruthfulQA, ETHICS, and Sycophancy as well as reduction in general capabilities as measured by MMLU. These findings highlight personality shaping as a powerful and underexplored axis of model control that interacts with both safety and general competence. We discuss the implications for safety evaluation, alignment strategies, steering model behavior after deployment, and risks associated with possible exploitation of these findings. Our findings motivate a new line of research on personality-sensitive safety evaluations and dynamic behavioral control in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SABER: Uncovering Vulnerabilities in Safety Alignment via Cross-Layer Residual Connection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16060v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones. However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study, we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation set.

| **[Learning Safety for Obstacle Avoidance via Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16037v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free, effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond existing CBF-based methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Reliable detection of unsafe driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads, including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection, driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context aware intelligent transportation solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Surface Alignment: Rebuilding LLMs Safety Mechanism via Probabilistically Ablating Refusal Direction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15202v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose persistent threats to large language models (LLMs). Current safety alignment methods have attempted to address these issues, but they experience two significant limitations: insufficient safety alignment depth and unrobust internal defense mechanisms. These limitations make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as prefilling and refusal direction manipulation. We introduce DeepRefusal, a robust safety alignment framework that overcomes these issues. DeepRefusal forces the model to dynamically rebuild its refusal mechanisms from jailbreak states. This is achieved by probabilistically ablating the refusal direction across layers and token depths during fine-tuning. Our method not only defends against prefilling and refusal direction attacks but also demonstrates strong resilience against other unseen jailbreak strategies. Extensive evaluations on four open-source LLM families and six representative attacks show that DeepRefusal reduces attack success rates by approximately 95%, while maintaining model capabilities with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Finding</p></details> |

Safety filters have gained increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |

Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we introduce \textsf{SGToxicGuard}, a novel dataset and evaluation framework for benchmarking LLM safety in Singapore's diverse linguistic context, including Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. SGToxicGuard adopts a red-teaming approach to systematically probe LLM vulnerabilities in three real-world scenarios: \textit{conversation}, \textit{question-answering}, and \textit{content composition}. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs, and the results uncover critical gaps in their safety guardrails. By offering actionable insights into cultural sensitivity and toxicity mitigation, we lay the foundation for safer and more inclusive AI systems in linguistically diverse environments.\footnote{Link to the dataset: https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/SGToxicGuard.} \textcolor{red}{Disclaimer: This paper contains sensitive content that may be disturbing to some readers.}</p></details> | 9 pages, EMNLP 2025 |

While most defenses target single-turn attacks, real-world usage often involves multi-turn dialogues, exposing models to attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety measures. We introduce MUSE, a comprehensive framework tackling multi-turn jailbreaks from both attack and defense angles. For attacks, we propose MUSE-A, a method that uses frame semantics and heuristic tree search to explore diverse semantic trajectories. For defense, we present MUSE-D, a fine-grained safety alignment approach that intervenes early in dialogues to reduce vulnerabilities. Extensive experiments on various models show that MUSE effectively identifies and mitigates multi-turn vulnerabilities.
