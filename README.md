| **[Omni-AutoThink: Adaptive Multimodal Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03783v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniGuard: Unified Omni-Modal Guardrails with Deliberate Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02306v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OralGPT-Omni: A Versatile Dental Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22055v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 42 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni: Scaling Language-Centric Omnimodal Large Model with Advanced MoE, Training and Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12609v2)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Uni-MoE 2.0 from the Lychee family. As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages,10 Figures, Project Website: https://idealistxy.github.io/Uni-MoE-v2.github.io/ Codes: https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Uni-MoE</p></details> |
| **[T-Rex-Omni: Integrating Negative Visual Prompt in Generic Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08997v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

| **[Omni-AVSR: Towards Unified Multimodal Speech Recognition with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07253v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore, we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise, and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://umbertocappellazzo.github.io/Omni-AVSR/</p></details> |
| **[Omni-View: Unlocking How Generation Facilitates Understanding in Unified 3D Model based on Multiview images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07222v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Omni-View, which extends the unified multimodal understanding and generation to 3D scenes based on multiview images, exploring the principle that "generation facilitates understanding". Consisting of understanding model, texture module, and geometry module, Omni-View jointly models scene understanding, novel view synthesis, and geometry estimation, enabling synergistic interaction between 3D scene understanding and generation tasks. By design, it leverages the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of its texture module responsible for appearance synthesis, alongside the explicit geometric constraints provided by its dedicated geometry module, thereby enriching the model's holistic understanding of 3D scenes. Trained with a two-stage strategy, Omni-View achieves a state-of-the-art score of 55.4 on the VSI-Bench benchmark, outperforming existing specialized 3D understanding models, while simultaneously delivering strong performance in both novel view synthesis and 3D scene generation.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Agent-Omni: Test-Time Multimodal Reasoning via Model Coordination for Understanding Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02834v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models become available.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables.

| **[LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00279v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ming-Flash-Omni: A Sparse, Unified Architecture for Multimodal Perception and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24821v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Ming-Flash-Omni, an upgraded version of Ming-Omni, built upon a sparser Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of Ling-Flash-2.0 with 100 billion total parameters, of which only 6.1 billion are active per token. This architecture enables highly efficient scaling (dramatically improving computational efficiency while significantly expanding model capacity) and empowers stronger unified multimodal intelligence across vision, speech, and language, representing a key step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial improvements across multimodal understanding and generation. We significantly advance speech recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation, a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[RoboOmni: Proactive Robot Manipulation in Omni-modal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23763v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Reward: Towards Generalist Omni-Modal Reward Modeling with Free-Form Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23451v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance, where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 17 figures |
| **[UNO-Bench: A Unified Benchmark for Exploring the Compositional Law Between Uni-modal and Omni-modal in Omni Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18915v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities, collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we introduce a novel, high-quality, and UNified Omni model benchmark, UNO-Bench. This benchmark is designed to effectively evaluate both UNi-modal and Omni-modal capabilities under a unified ability taxonomy, spanning 44 task types and 5 modality combinations. It includes 1250 human curated samples for omni-modal with 98% cross-modality solvability, and 2480 enhanced uni-modal samples. The human-generated dataset is well-suited to real-world scenarios, particularly within the Chinese context, whereas the automatically compressed dataset offers a 90% increase in speed and maintains 98% consistency across 18 public benchmarks. In addition to traditional multi-choice questions, we propose an innovative multi-step open-ended question format to assess complex reasoning. A general scoring model is incorporated, supporting 6 question types for automated evaluation with 95% accuracy. Experimental result shows the Compositional Law between omni-modal and uni-modal performance and the omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: S...</summary><p>v3: Switch the paper template.

Our benchmark excels in three key areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities, focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset and code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LongInsightBench-910F/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR Rolling Review</p></details> |

We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T.

| **[XModBench: Benchmarking Cross-Modal Capabilities and Consistency in Omni-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15148v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.</p></details> |  |
| **[InteractiveOmni: A Unified Omni-modal Model for Audio-Visual Multi-turn Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13747v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience, particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[NExT-OMNI: Towards Any-to-Any Omnimodal Foundation Models with Discrete Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13721v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Captioner: Data Pipeline, Models, and Benchmark for Omni Detailed Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12720v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ddlBoJack/Omni-Captioner</p></details> |
| **[SAIL-Embedding Technical Report: Omni-modal Embedding Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12709v3)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.5% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.1% AUC gain.</p></details> | Technical Report |

| **[CLIO: A Tour Guide Robot with Co-speech Actions for Visual Attention Guidance and Enhanced User Engagement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05389v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While audio guides can offer rich information about an exhibit, it is challenging for visitors to focus on specific exhibit details based only on the verbal description. We present \textit{CLIO}, a tour guide robot with co-speech actions to direct visitors' visual attention and thus enhance the overall user engagement in a guided tour. \textit{CLIO} is equipped with designed actions to engage visitors. It builds eye contact with the visitor through tracking a visitor's face and blinking its eyes, or orient their attention by its head movement and laser pointer. We further use a Large Language Model (LLM) to coordinate the designed actions with a given narrative script for exhibition. We conducted a user study to evaluate the \textit{CLIO} system in a mock-up exhibition of historical photographs.

| **[Systematically Evaluating Equivalent Purpose for Digital Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05310v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital geographic maps remain largely inaccessible to blind and low-vision individuals (BLVIs), despite global legislation adopting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). A critical gap exists in defining "equivalent purpose" for maps under WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1, which requires that non-text content provide a text alternative that serves the "equivalent purpose". This paper proposes a systematic framework for evaluating map accessibility, called the Map Equivalent-Purpose Framework (MEP Framework), defining purpose through three items (Generalized, Spatial Information, and Spatial Relationships), and establishing 15 measurable criteria for equivalent information communication. Eight text map representations were evaluated against visual map baselines using the proposed MEP Framework. Results show that legacy methods such as tables and turn-by-turn directions fail to meet the MEP Framework criteria, while Audiom Maps, Multi User Domain (MUD) Maps, and Audio Descriptions meet the criteria. The evaluation highlights the necessity of holistic, systematic approaches to ensure non-visual maps convey all generalized spatial information and relationships present in visual maps. The MEP Framework provides a replicable methodology for comprehensively assessing digital map accessibility, clarifying WCAG's "equivalent purpose", and guiding compliant and usable map creation. Compliant maps will support BLVIs' participation in map-dependent professions and civic engagement.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In press at Journal on Technology and Persons with Disabilities, volume 14</p></details> |

We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.</p></details> |  |

Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://carlyx.github.io/UniMo/</p></details> |

However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Boundary Frames: Audio-Visual Semantic Guidance for Context-Aware Video Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03590v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling fast, complex, and highly non-linear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning.</p></details> |  |

We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> |

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering. We release our Slide Translation code at https://github.com/saikoneru/image-translator and integrate it in Lecture Translator at https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/isl-ai4lt/lt-middleware/ltpipeline}\footnote{All released code and models are licensed under the MIT License.</p></details> | Under review |

Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02650v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02457v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models.

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Learning Visual Affordance from Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02005v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Audio-Visual Affordance Grounding (AV-AG), a new task that segments object interaction regions from action sounds. Unlike existing approaches that rely on textual instructions or demonstration videos, which often limited by ambiguity or occlusion, audio provides real-time, semantically rich, and visually independent cues for affordance grounding, enabling more intuitive understanding of interaction regions. To support this task, we construct the first AV-AG dataset, comprising a large collection of action sounds, object images, and pixel-level affordance annotations. The dataset also includes an unseen subset to evaluate zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we propose AVAGFormer, a model equipped with a semantic-conditioned cross-modal mixer and a dual-head decoder that effectively fuses audio and visual signals for mask prediction. Experiments show that AVAGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on AV-AG, surpassing baselines from related tasks. Comprehensive analyses highlight the distinctions between AV-AG and AVS, the benefits of end-to-end modeling, and the contribution of each component.

The main challenge lies in integrating sentiment-related information from different modalities, which typically arises during the unimodal feature extraction phase and the multimodal feature fusion phase. Existing methods extract only shallow information from unimodal features during the extraction phase, neglecting sentimental differences across different personalities. During the fusion phase, they directly merge the feature information from each modality without considering differences at the feature level. This ultimately affects the model's recognition performance. To address this problem, we propose a personality-sentiment aligned multi-level fusion framework. We introduce personality traits during the feature extraction phase and propose a novel personality-sentiment alignment method to obtain personalized sentiment embeddings from the textual modality for the first time. In the fusion phase, we introduce a novel multi-level fusion method. This method gradually integrates sentimental information from textual, visual, and audio modalities through multimodal pre-fusion and a multi-level enhanced fusion strategy. Our method has been evaluated through multiple experiments on two commonly used datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 accepted |

While existing approaches have primarily focused on visual observations, real-world perception inherently involves multiple sensory modalities. Audio provides crucial spatial and temporal cues such as sound source localization and acoustic scene properties, yet its integration into world models remains largely unexplored. No prior work has formally defined what constitutes an audio-visual world model or how to jointly capture binaural spatial audio and visual dynamics under precise action control with task reward prediction. This work presents the first formal framework for Audio-Visual World Models (AVWM), formulating multimodal environment simulation as a partially observable Markov decision process with synchronized audio-visual observations, fine-grained actions, and task rewards. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct AVW-4k, a dataset comprising 30 hours of binaural audio-visual trajectories with action annotations and reward signals across 76 indoor environments. We propose AV-CDiT, an Audio-Visual Conditional Diffusion Transformer with a novel modality expert architecture that balances visual and auditory learning, optimized through a three-stage training strategy for effective multimodal integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AV-CDiT achieves high-fidelity multimodal prediction across visual and auditory modalities with reward. Furthermore, we validate its practical utility in continuous audio-visual navigation tasks, where AVWM significantly enhances the agent's performance.</p></details> |  |

Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Existing synthetic video datasets predominantly focus on the visual modality alone, while the few incorporating audio are largely confined to facial deepfakes--a limitation that fails to address the expanding landscape of general multimodal AI-generated content and substantially impedes the development of trustworthy detection systems. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the Multimodal Video-Audio Dataset (MVAD), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated multimodal video-audio content. Our dataset exhibits three key characteristics: (1) genuine multimodality with samples generated according to three realistic video-audio forgery patterns; (2) high perceptual quality achieved through diverse state-of-the-art generative models; and (3) comprehensive diversity spanning realistic and anime visual styles, four content categories (humans, animals, objects, and scenes), and four video-audio multimodal data types.

However, current approaches mainly focus on UAV placement, routing, and resource management, neglecting the autonomous perception of users and their service demands - a critical capability for zero-touch network operation. This paper presents the Multi-Agent Perception System (MAPS), a modular and scalable system that leverages multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) and agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) to interpret visual and audio data collected by UAVs and generate Service Level Specifications (SLSs) describing user count, spatial distribution, and traffic demand. MAPS is evaluated using a synthetic multimodal emergency dataset, achieving user detection accuracies above 70% and SLS generation under 130 seconds in 90% of cases. Results demonstrate that combining audio and visual modalities enhances user detection and show that MAPS provides the perception layer required for autonomous, zero-touch FNs.</p></details> |  |

However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for ACL 2026</p></details> |
