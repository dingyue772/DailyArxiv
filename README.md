| **[ReasonFlux-PRM: Trajectory-Aware PRMs for Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18896v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

| **[LongWriter-Zero: Mastering Ultra-Long Text Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18841v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on ''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B, consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under https://huggingface.co/THU-KEG/LongWriter-Zero-32B</p></details> |  |
| **[RDPO: Real Data Preference Optimization for Physics Consistency Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18655v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive. Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The source code and demonstration of this paper are available at: https://wwenxu.github.io/RDPO/</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Shrinking the Generation-Verification Gap with Weak Verifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18203v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean). While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers, which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a 400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflective Verbal Reward Design for Pluralistic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17834v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However, human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences. This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted to the IJCAI 2025 Human-Centred AI track.

| **[DuaShepherd: Integrating Stepwise Correctness and Potential Rewards for Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17533v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup, demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone, achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16853v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Under review</p></details> |
| **[ReasonGRM: Enhancing Generative Reward Models through Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16712v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reward Modeling via Causal Rubrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16507v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors, leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically, Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N, across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat, chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and the reasoning-specific GSM8k.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relic: Enhancing Reward Model Generalization for Low-Resource Indic Languages with Few-Shot Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16502v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13% improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example selection method, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16114v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem. Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/AutoRule.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARE: Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation for Automatic Process Supervision and Reward Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15498v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main content, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reward Models in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15421v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling. Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2025 Survey Track (To Appear)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Accompaniment with ReaLchords](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14723v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jamming requires coordination, anticipation, and collaborative creativity between musicians. Current generative models of music produce expressive output but are not able to generate in an \emph{online} manner, meaning simultaneously with other musicians (human or otherwise). We propose ReaLchords, an online generative model for improvising chord accompaniment to user melody. We start with an online model pretrained by maximum likelihood, and use reinforcement learning to finetune the model for online use. The finetuning objective leverages both a novel reward model that provides feedback on both harmonic and temporal coherency between melody and chord, and a divergence term that implements a novel type of distillation from a teacher model that can see the future melody. Through quantitative experiments and listening tests, we demonstrate that the resulting model adapts well to unfamiliar input and produce fitting accompaniment. ReaLchords opens the door to live jamming, as well as simultaneous co-creation in other modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[SENIOR: Efficient Query Selection and Preference-Guided Exploration in Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14648v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) methods provide a solution to avoid reward engineering by learning reward models based on human preferences. However, poor feedback- and sample- efficiency still remain the problems that hinder the application of PbRL. In this paper, we present a novel efficient query selection and preference-guided exploration method, called SENIOR, which could select the meaningful and easy-to-comparison behavior segment pairs to improve human feedback-efficiency and accelerate policy learning with the designed preference-guided intrinsic rewards. Our key idea is twofold: (1) We designed a Motion-Distinction-based Selection scheme (MDS). It selects segment pairs with apparent motion and different directions through kernel density estimation of states, which is more task-related and easy for human preference labeling; (2) We proposed a novel preference-guided exploration method (PGE). It encourages the exploration towards the states with high preference and low visits and continuously guides the agent achieving the valuable samples. The synergy between the two mechanisms could significantly accelerate the progress of reward and policy learning. Our experiments show that SENIOR outperforms other five existing methods in both human feedback-efficiency and policy convergence speed on six complex robot manipulation tasks from simulation and four real-worlds.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[TGDPO: Harnessing Token-Level Reward Guidance for Enhancing Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14574v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning from human feedback have shown that utilizing fine-grained token-level reward models can substantially enhance the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in aligning large language models. However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard. Code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/TGDPO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Although Thompson Sampling performs well empirically, it does not achieve optimal regret bounds. This paper proposes a nearly minimax optimal Thompson Sampling for linear contextual bandits by developing a novel estimator with the adaptive augmentation and coupling of the hypothetical samples that are designed for efficient parameter learning. The proposed estimator accurately predicts rewards for all arms without relying on assumptions for the context distribution. Empirical results show robust performance and significant improvement over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAM: A Generative Foundation Reward Model for Reward Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14175v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In aligning large language models (LLMs), reward models have played an important role, but are standardly trained as discriminative models and rely only on labeled human preference data. In this paper, we explore methods that train reward models using both unlabeled and labeled data. Building on the generative models in LLMs, we develop a generative reward model that is first trained via large-scale unsupervised learning and then fine-tuned via supervised learning. We also show that by using label smoothing, we are in fact optimizing a regularized pairwise ranking loss. This result, in turn, provides a new view of training reward models, which links generative models and discriminative models under the same class of training objectives. The outcome of these techniques is a foundation reward model, which can be applied to a wide range of tasks with little or no further fine-tuning effort. Extensive experiments show that this model generalizes well across several tasks, including response ranking, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and task adaptation with fine-tuning, achieving significant performance improvements over several strong baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[VL-GenRM: Enhancing Vision-Language Verification via Vision Experts and Iterative Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13888v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with verifiable rewards has advanced large language models but remains underexplored for Vision-Language (VL) models. The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training. To address these issues, we propose an iterative training framework leveraging vision experts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling. Our approach refines preference datasets, enhances structured critiques, and iteratively improves reasoning. Experiments across VL-RM benchmarks demonstrate superior performance in hallucination detection and multimodal reasoning, advancing VL model alignment with reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

Evaluating Exploratory, Compositional, and Transformative Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18880v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[STU-PID: Steering Token Usage via PID Controller for Efficient Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18831v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while significantly improving computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are available at https://github.com/tsa18/ConciseHint</p></details> |

Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based systems.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/keke-nice/MedTVT-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Standard Applicability Judgment and Cross-jurisdictional Reasoning: A RAG-based Framework for Medical Device Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18511v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeRF: Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18485v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''. Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt, which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that \texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover, ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TReB: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Table Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18421v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables, databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap, presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and the framework on [GitHub].</p></details> | Benmark report v1.0 |
| **[InternSpatial: A Comprehensive Dataset for Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18385v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), yet existing open resources remain limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less Data Less Tokens: Multilingual Unification Learning for Efficient Test-Time Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18341v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of \(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore, \(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, as part of our mission to enhancing education and knowledge dissemination with AI, Confucius3-Math is specifically committed to mathematics learning for Chinese K-12 students and educators. Built via post-training with large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), Confucius3-Math aligns with national curriculum and excels at solving main-stream Chinese K-12 mathematical problems with low cost. In this report we share our development recipe, the challenges we encounter and the techniques we develop to overcome them. In particular, we introduce three technical innovations: Targeted Entropy Regularization, Recent Sample Recovery and Policy-Specific Hardness Weighting. These innovations encompass a new entropy regularization, a novel data scheduling policy, and an improved group-relative advantage estimator. Collectively, they significantly stabilize the RL training, improve data efficiency, and boost performance. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of building strong reasoning models in a particular domain at low cost. We open-source our model and code at https://github.com/netease-youdao/Confucius3-Math.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdapThink: Adaptive Thinking Preferences for Reasoning Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18237v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models' evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically, AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drive-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Planning in VLMs for Autonomous Driving with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18234v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and (2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1 designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1 first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future research and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning about Uncertainty: Do Reasoning Models Know When They Don't Know?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18183v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Reasoning in Thinking Language Models via Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18167v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL for Reasoning by Adaptively Revealing Rationales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18110v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to partial solutions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics (fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that $\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$.

However, modern multimodal models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering, answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all 7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy video-language understanding.
