| **[AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10513v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROMA: Real-time Omni-Multimodal Assistant with Interactive Streaming Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10323v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page is available at https://eureka-maggie.github.io/ROMA_show</p></details> |
| **[Omni-R1: Towards the Unified Generative Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09536v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech-Hands: A Self-Reflection Voice Agentic Approach to Speech Recognition and Audio Reasoning with Omni Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09413v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a voice-agentic framework that learns one critical omni-understanding skill: knowing when to trust itself versus when to consult external audio perception. Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets. By unifying perception and decision-making, our work offers a practical path toward more reliable and resilient audio intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[e5-omni: Explicit Cross-modal Alignment for Omni-modal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03666v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B</p></details> |
| **[HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01792v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni, the first any-to-any omnimodal model in the HyperCLOVA X family that supports text, audio, and vision as both inputs and outputs. By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Omni-Weather: Unified Multimodal Foundation Model for Weather Generation and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21643v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather modeling requires both accurate prediction and mechanistic interpretation, yet existing methods treat these goals in isolation, separating generation from understanding. To address this gap, we present Omni-Weather, the first multimodal foundation model that unifies weather generation and understanding within a single architecture. Omni-Weather integrates a radar encoder for weather generation tasks, followed by unified processing using a shared self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset for causal reasoning in weather generation, enabling interpretable outputs and improved perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show Omni-Weather achieves state-of-the-art performance in both weather generation and understanding. Our findings further indicate that generative and understanding tasks in the weather domain can mutually enhance each other. Omni-Weather also demonstrates the feasibility and value of unifying weather generation and understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[UmniBench: Unified Understand and Generation Model Oriented Omni-dimensional Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17196v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://umnibench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SFBD-OMNI: Bridge models for lossy measurement restoration with limited clean samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17051v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal RewardBench 2: Evaluating Omni Reward Models for Interleaved Text and Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16899v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) are essential for training large language models (LLMs), but remain underexplored for omni models that handle interleaved image and text sequences. We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MMRB2</p></details> |
| **[Kling-Omni Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16776v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kling...</summary><p>Kling-Omni Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[OMUDA: Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12303v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables semantic segmentation models to generalize from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%.</p></details> | Submitted to TMM |
| **[Omni-Attribute: Open-vocabulary Attribute Encoder for Visual Concept Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10955v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/omni-attribute</p></details> |
| **[AgriGPT-Omni: A Unified Speech-Vision-Text Framework for Multilingual Agricultural Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10624v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronusOmni: Improving Time Awareness of Omni Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09841v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time awareness is a fundamental ability of omni large language models, especially for understanding long videos and answering complex questions. Previous approaches mainly target vision-language scenarios and focus on the explicit temporal grounding questions, such as identifying when a visual event occurs or determining what event happens at aspecific time. However, they often make insufficient use of the audio modality, and overlook implicit temporal grounding across modalities--for example, identifying what is visually present when a character speaks, or determining what is said when a visual event occurs--despite such cross-modal temporal relations being prevalent in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ChronusOmni, an omni large language model designed to enhance temporal awareness for both explicit and implicit audiovisual temporal grounding. First, we interleave text-based timestamp tokens with visual and audio representations at each time unit, enabling unified temporal modeling across modalities. Second, to enforce correct temporal ordering and strengthen fine-grained temporal reasoning, we incorporate reinforcement learning with specially designed reward functions. Moreover, we construct ChronusAV, a temporally-accurate, modality-complete, and cross-modal-aligned dataset to support the training and evaluation on audiovisual temporal grounding task. Experimental results demonstrate that ChronusOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance on ChronusAV with more than 30% improvement and top results on most metrics upon other temporal grounding benchmarks. This highlights the strong temporal awareness of our model across modalities, while preserving general video and audio understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/YJCX330/Chronus/</p></details> |
| **[Omni-Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06862v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel task termed Omni-Referring Image Segmentation (OmniRIS) towards highly generalized image segmentation. Compared with existing unimodally conditioned segmentation tasks, such as RIS and visual RIS, OmniRIS supports the input of text instructions and reference images with masks, boxes or scribbles as omni-prompts. This property makes it can well exploit the intrinsic merits of both text and visual modalities, i.e., granular attribute referring and uncommon object grounding, respectively. Besides, OmniRIS can also handle various segmentation settings, such as one v.s. many and many v.s. many, further facilitating its practical use. To promote the research of OmniRIS, we also rigorously design and construct a large dataset termed OmniRef, which consists of 186,939 omni-prompts for 30,956 images, and establish a comprehensive evaluation system. Moreover, a strong and general baseline termed OmniSegNet is also proposed to tackle the key challenges of OmniRIS, such as omni-prompt encoding. The extensive experiments not only validate the capability of OmniSegNet in following omni-modal instructions, but also show the superiority of OmniRIS for highly generalized image segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-AutoThink: Adaptive Multimodal Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03783v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Omni models have enabled unified multimodal perception and generation. However, most existing systems still exhibit rigid reasoning behaviors, either overthinking simple problems or failing to reason when necessary. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-AutoThink, a novel adaptive reasoning framework that dynamically adjusts the model's reasoning depth according to task difficulty. Our framework comprises two stages: (1) an Adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning (Adaptive SFT) stage, which endows the Omni model with fundamental reasoning capability using large-scale reasoning-augmented data, and (2) an Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive GRPO) stage, which optimizes reasoning behaviors based on task complexity and reward feedback. We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines. All benchmark data and code will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniGuard: Unified Omni-Modal Guardrails with Deliberate Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02306v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis.

As a fully open-source omnimodal large model (OLM), it substantially advances Lychee's Uni-MoE series in language-centric multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generating. Based on the dense LLM, we build Uni-MoE-2.0-Omni from scratch through three core contributions: dynamic-capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design, a progressive training strategy enhanced with an iterative reinforcement strategy, and a carefully curated multimodal data matching technique. It is capable of omnimodal understanding, as well as generating images, text, and speech. Architecturally, our new MoE framework balances computational efficiency and capability for 10 cross-modal inputs using shared, routed, and null experts, while our Omni-Modality 3D RoPE ensures spatio-temporal cross-modality alignment in the self-attention layer. For training, following cross-modal pretraining, we use a progressive supervised fine-tuning strategy that activates modality-specific experts and is enhanced by balanced data composition and an iterative GSPO-DPO method to stabilise RL training and improve reasoning. Data-wise, the base model, trained on approximately 75B tokens of open-source multimodal data, is equipped with special speech and image generation tokens, allowing it to learn these generative tasks by conditioning its outputs on linguistic cues. Extensive evaluation across 85 benchmarks demonstrates that our model achieves SOTA or highly competitive performance against leading OLMs, surpassing Qwen2.5-Omni (trained with 1.2T tokens) on over 50 of 76 benchmarks. Key strengths include video understanding (+7% avg. of 8), omnimodallity understanding (+7% avg. of 4), and audiovisual reasoning (+4%). It also advances long-form speech processing (reducing WER by 4.2%) and leads in low-level image processing and controllable generation across 5 metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages,10 Figures, Project Website: https://idealistxy.github.io/Uni-MoE-v2.github.io/ Codes: https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/Uni-MoE</p></details> |

However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |

The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient On-Board Processing of Oblique UAV Video for Rapid Flood Extent Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11290v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions</p></details> |  |
| **[FTDMamba: Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11254v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[VidLeaks: Membership Inference Attacks Against Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11210v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of powerful Text-to-Video (T2V) models, trained on massive web-scale datasets, raises urgent concerns about copyright and privacy violations. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled tool for auditing such risks, yet existing techniques - designed for static data like images or text - fail to capture the spatio-temporal complexities of video generation. In particular, they overlook the sparsity of memorization signals in keyframes and the instability introduced by stochastic temporal dynamics. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of MIAs against T2V models and introduce a novel framework VidLeaks, which probes sparse-temporal memorization through two complementary signals: 1) Spatial Reconstruction Fidelity (SRF), using a Top-K similarity to amplify spatial memorization signals from sparsely memorized keyframes, and 2) Temporal Generative Stability (TGS), which measures semantic consistency across multiple queries to capture temporal leakage. We evaluate VidLeaks under three progressively restrictive black-box settings - supervised, reference-based, and query-only. Experiments on three representative T2V models reveal severe vulnerabilities: VidLeaks achieves AUC of 82.92% on AnimateDiff and 97.01% on InstructVideo even in the strict query-only setting, posing a realistic and exploitable privacy risk. Our work provides the first concrete evidence that T2V models leak substantial membership information through both sparse and temporal memorization, establishing a foundation for auditing video generation systems and motivating the development of new defenses.

| **[PhysRVG: Physics-Aware Unified Reinforcement Learning for Video Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11087v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3DDM+: An improved video outpainting by a modified masking strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11048v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tamaki-lab/M3DDM-Plus.</p></details> | proc. of IWAIT2026 |

While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MMSys 2026. 12 pages, 8 figures.

However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field. \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness. \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored. Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection. Our benchmark is open-sourced at https://github.com/LongMa-2025/AIGVDBench.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Site (Code, Models, Demo): https://fofpred.github.io</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMoVi: Co-Generation of 3D Human Motions and Realistic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10632v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://igl-hkust.github.io/CoMoVi/</p></details> |
| **[Molmo2: Open Weights and Data for Vision-Language Models with Video Understanding and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10611v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  |

Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-time Physics Alignment of Video Generative Models with Latent World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10553v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

The evaluation follows the same test methodology and conditions previously defined for MPEG multilayer video coding assessments, with the LCEVC enhancement layer encoded using version 8.1 of the LCEVC Test Model (LTM). The test compares reconstructed UHD output generated from an HD VVC base layer with LCEVC enhancement against two reference cases: upsampled VVC base layer decoding and multilayer VVC (ML-VVC). Two operating points are considered, corresponding to enhancement layers representing approximately 10% and 50% of the total bitrate. Subjective assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology with twenty five participants, across a dataset comprising fifteen SDR and HDR sequences. The reported results include Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with associated 95% confidence intervals, enabling comparison of perceptual quality across coding approaches and operating points within the defined test scope.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a frontier in computer vision, requiring approaches that effectively model the shape and motion of objects without rigid boundaries, extract hierarchical spatiotemporal features from entire image sequences rather than static frames, and account for multiple objects within the field of view. To this end, we organized the Cell Behavior Video Classification Challenge (CBVCC), benchmarking 35 methods based on three approaches: classification of tracking-derived features, end-to-end deep learning architectures to directly learn spatiotemporal features from the entire video sequence without explicit cell tracking, or ensembling tracking-derived with image-derived features. We discuss the results achieved by the participants and compare the potential and limitations of each approach, serving as a basis to foster the development of computer vision methods for studying cellular dynamics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Beyond Inpainting: Unleash 3D Understanding for Precise Camera-Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10214v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kim-youwang.github.io/elite</p></details> |
