| **[Omni-iEEG: A Large-Scale, Comprehensive iEEG Dataset and Benchmark for Epilepsy Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16072v2)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

| **[OMNI-LEAK: Orchestrator Multi-Agent Network Induced Data Leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13477v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more capable, their coordinated use in the form of multi-agent systems is anticipated to emerge as a practical paradigm. Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepi...</summary><p>Prepint, under review for ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[DreamID-Omni: Unified Framework for Controllable Human-Centric Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12160v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://guoxu1233.github.io/DreamID-Omni/</p></details> |
| **[Tele-Omni: a Unified Multimodal Framework for Video Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09609v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Safety under Cross-Modality Conflict: Vulnerabilities, Dynamics Mechanisms and Efficient Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10161v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) greatly expand LLMs' multimodal capabilities but also introduce cross-modal safety risks. However, a systematic understanding of vulnerabilities in omni-modal interactions remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we establish a modality-semantics decoupling principle and construct the AdvBench-Omni dataset, which reveals a significant vulnerability in OLLMs. Mechanistic analysis uncovers a Mid-layer Dissolution phenomenon driven by refusal vector magnitude shrinkage, alongside the existence of a modal-invariant pure refusal direction. Inspired by these insights, we extract a golden refusal vector using Singular Value Decomposition and propose OmniSteer, which utilizes lightweight adapters to modulate intervention intensity adaptively. Extensive experiments show that our method not only increases the Refusal Success Rate against harmful inputs from 69.9% to 91.2%, but also effectively preserves the general capabilities across all modalities. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhrli324/omni-safety-research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Video 2: Scaling MLLM-Conditioned Diffusion for Unified Video Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08820v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Omni-Video 2, a scalable and computationally efficient model that connects pretrained multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) with video diffusion models for unified video generation and editing. Our key idea is to exploit the understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to produce explicit target captions to interpret user instructions. In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner. Benefiting from these designs, we scale up Omni-Video 2 to a 14B video diffusion model on meticulously curated training data with quality, supporting high quality text-to-video generation and various video editing tasks such as object removal, addition, background change, complex motion editing, \emph{etc.} We evaluate the performance of Omni-Video 2 on the FiVE benchmark for fine-grained video editing and the VBench benchmark for text-to-video generation. The results demonstrate its superior ability to follow complex compositional instructions in video editing, while also achieving competitive or superior quality in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project: https://howellyoung-s.github.io/Omni-Video2-project/</p></details> |
| **[Ex-Omni: Enabling 3D Facial Animation Generation for Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07106v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify multimodal understanding and generation, yet incorporating speech with 3D facial animation remains largely unexplored despite its importance for natural interaction. A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Physical Intelligence Emergence via Omni-Modal Architecture and Physical Data Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07064v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical understanding remains brittle in omni-modal models because key physical attributes are visually ambiguous and sparsely represented in web-scale data. We present OmniFysics, a compact omni-modal model that unifies understanding across images, audio, video, and text, with integrated speech and image generation. To inject explicit physical knowledge, we build a physical data engine with two components. FysicsAny produces physics-grounded instruction--image supervision by mapping salient objects to verified physical attributes through hierarchical retrieval over a curated prototype database, followed by physics-law--constrained verification and caption rewriting. FysicsOmniCap distills web videos via audio--visual consistency filtering to generate high-fidelity video--instruction pairs emphasizing cross-modal physical cues. We train OmniFysics with staged multimodal alignment and instruction tuning, adopt latent-space flow matching for text-to-image generation, and use an intent router to activate generation only when needed. Experiments show competitive performance on standard multimodal benchmarks and improved results on physics-oriented evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04804v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[OMNI-Dent: Towards an Accessible and Explainable AI Framework for Automated Dental Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07041v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate dental diagnosis is essential for oral healthcare, yet many individuals lack access to timely professional evaluation. Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals. These approaches also require large amounts of expert-annotated data and often struggle to generalize across diverse real-world imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuardReasoner-Omni: A Reasoning-based Multi-modal Guardrail for Text, Image, and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03328v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GuardReasoner-Omni, a reasoning-based guardrail model designed to moderate text, image, and video data. First, we construct a comprehensive training corpus comprising 148k samples spanning these three modalities. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage paradigm to incentivize the model to deliberate before making decisions: (1) conducting SFT to cold-start the model with explicit reasoning capabilities and structural adherence; and (2) performing RL, incorporating an error-driven exploration reward to incentivize deeper reasoning on hard samples. We release a suite of models scaled at 2B and 4B parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GuardReasoner-Omni achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines across various guardrail benchmarks. Notably, GuardReasoner-Omni (2B) significantly surpasses the runner-up by 5.3% F1 score.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-RRM: Advancing Omni Reward Modeling via Automatic Rubric-Grounded Preference Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00846v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet their performance is often capped by the coarse nature of existing alignment techniques. A critical bottleneck remains the lack of effective reward models (RMs): existing RMs are predominantly vision-centric, return opaque scalar scores, and rely on costly human annotations. We introduce \textbf{Omni-RRM}, the first open-source rubric-grounded reward model that produces structured, multi-dimension preference judgments with dimension-wise justifications across \textbf{text, image, video, and audio}. At the core of our approach is \textbf{Omni-Preference}, a large-scale dataset built via a fully automated pipeline: we synthesize candidate response pairs by contrasting models of different capabilities, and use strong teacher models to \emph{reconcile and filter} preferences while providing a modality-aware \emph{rubric-grounded rationale} for each pair. This eliminates the need for human-labeled training preferences. Omni-RRM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning to learn the rubric-grounded outputs, followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) to sharpen discrimination on difficult, low-contrast pairs. Comprehensive evaluations show that Omni-RRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video (80.2\% on ShareGPT-V) and audio (66.8\% on Audio-HH-RLHF) benchmarks, and substantially outperforms existing open-source RMs on image tasks, with a 17.7\% absolute gain over its base model on overall accuracy. Omni-RRM also improves downstream performance via Best-of-$N$ selection and transfers to text-only preference benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Omni-RRM-CC08.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-fMRI: A Universal Atlas-Free fMRI Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23090v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised fMRI foundation models have shown promising transfer performance, yet most rely on predefined region-level parcellations that discard fine-grained voxel information and introduce atlas-dependent biases. We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Alignment Curse: Cross-Modality Jailbreak Transfer in Omni-Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02557v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Omni: A Unified Autoregressive Model for Any-to-Any Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17761v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-directional attention mechanism based on Mamba for speech separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16603v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a selective state-space model (SSM), has emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformers for speech modeling, enabling long-sequence processing with linear complexity. While effective in speech separation, existing approaches, whether in the time or time-frequency domain, typically decompose the input along a single dimension into short one-dimensional sequences before processing them with Mamba, which restricts it to local 1D modeling and limits its ability to capture global dependencies across the 2D spectrogram. In this work, we propose an efficient omni-directional attention (OA) mechanism built upon unidirectional Mamba, which models global dependencies from ten different directions on the spectrogram. We expand the proposed mechanism into two baseline separation models and evaluate on three public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach consistently achieves significant performance gains over the baselines while preserving linear complexity, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FutureOmni: Evaluating Future Forecasting from Omni-Modal Context for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13836v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong omni-modal perception, their ability to forecast future events from audio-visual cues remains largely unexplored, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on retrospective understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni).</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openmoss.github.io/FutureOmni</p></details> |
| **[AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10513v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.</p></details> |  |

| **[Human Video Generation from a Single Image with 3D Pose and View Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21188v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion methods have made significant progress in generating videos from single images due to their powerful visual generation capabilities. However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[UDVideoQA: A Traffic Video Question Answering Dataset for Multi-Object Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Urban Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21137v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the complex, multi-agent dynamics of urban traffic remains a fundamental challenge for video language models. This paper introduces Urban Dynamics VideoQA, a benchmark dataset that captures the unscripted real-world behavior of dynamic urban scenes. UDVideoQA is curated from 16 hours of traffic footage recorded at multiple city intersections under diverse traffic, weather, and lighting conditions. It employs an event-driven dynamic blur technique to ensure privacy preservation without compromising scene fidelity. Using a unified annotation pipeline, the dataset contains 28K question-answer pairs generated across 8 hours of densely annotated video, averaging one question per second. Its taxonomy follows a hierarchical reasoning level, spanning basic understanding and attribution to event reasoning, reverse reasoning, and counterfactual inference, enabling systematic evaluation of both visual grounding and causal reasoning. Comprehensive experiments benchmark 10 SOTA VideoLMs on UDVideoQA and 8 models on a complementary video question generation benchmark. Results reveal a persistent perception-reasoning gap, showing models that excel in abstract inference often fail with fundamental visual grounding. While models like Gemini Pro achieve the highest zero-shot accuracy, fine-tuning the smaller Qwen2.5-VL 7B model on UDVideoQA bridges this gap, achieving performance comparable to proprietary systems. In VideoQGen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Qwen3 Max generate the most relevant and complex questions, though all models exhibit limited linguistic diversity, underscoring the need for human-centric evaluation. The UDVideoQA suite, including the dataset, annotation tools, and benchmarks for both VideoQA and VideoQGen, provides a foundation for advancing robust, privacy-aware, and real-world multimodal reasoning. UDVideoQA is available at https://ud-videoqa.github.io/UD-VideoQA/UD-VideoQA/.</p></details> |  |
| **[VII: Visual Instruction Injection for Jailbreaking Image-to-Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20999v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-Video (I2V) generation models, which condition video generation on reference images, have shown emerging visual instruction-following capability, allowing certain visual cues in reference images to act as implicit control signals for video generation. However, this capability also introduces a previously overlooked risk: adversaries may exploit visual instructions to inject malicious intent through the image modality. In this work, we uncover this risk by proposing Visual Instruction Injection (VII), a training-free and transferable jailbreaking framework that intentionally disguises the malicious intent of unsafe text prompts as benign visual instructions in the safe reference image. Specifically, VII coordinates a Malicious Intent Reprogramming module to distill malicious intent from unsafe text prompts while minimizing their static harmfulness, and a Visual Instruction Grounding module to ground the distilled intent onto a safe input image by rendering visual instructions that preserve semantic consistency with the original unsafe text prompt, thereby inducing harmful content during I2V generation. Empirically, our extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art commercial I2V models (Kling-v2.5-turbo, Gemini Veo-3.1, Seedance-1.5-pro, and PixVerse-V5) demonstrate that VII achieves Attack Success Rates of up to 83.5% while reducing Refusal Rates to near zero, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://Zbwwwwwwww.github.io/VII</p></details> |

In this work, we tackle the scaling challenge in multimodal-to-audio generation, examining whether models trained on short instances can generalize to longer ones during testing. To tackle this challenge, we present multimodal hierarchical networks so-called MMHNet, an enhanced extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models. Our approach integrates a hierarchical method and non-causal Mamba to support long-form audio generation. Our proposed method significantly improves long audio generation up to more than 5 minutes. We also prove that training short and testing long is possible in the video-to-audio generation tasks without training on the longer durations. We show in our experiments that our proposed method could achieve remarkable results on long-video to audio benchmarks, beating prior works in video-to-audio tasks. Moreover, we showcase our model capability in generating more than 5 minutes, while prior video-to-audio methods fall short in generating with long durations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |

We propose LongVideo-R1, an active, reasoning-equipped multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent designed for efficient video context navigation, avoiding the redundancy of exhaustive search. At the core of LongVideo-R1 lies a reasoning module that leverages high-level visual cues to infer the most informative video clip for subsequent processing. During inference, the agent initiates traversal from top-level visual summaries and iteratively refines its focus, immediately halting the exploration process upon acquiring sufficient knowledge to answer the query. To facilitate training, we first extract hierarchical video captions from CGBench, a video corpus with grounding annotations, and guide GPT-5 to generate 33K high-quality chain-of-thought-with-tool trajectories. The LongVideo-R1 agent is fine-tuned upon the Qwen-3-8B model through a two-stage paradigm: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL), where RL employs a specifically designed reward function to maximize selective and efficient clip navigation. Experiments on multiple long video benchmarks validate the effectiveness of name, which enjoys superior tradeoff between QA accuracy and efficiency. All curated data and source code are provided in the supplementary material and will be made publicly available.

Current approaches based on static diffusion models, whether used in a one-shot manner or within multi-agent frameworks, face three key limitations: (1) Static models lack dynamic expressiveness and often resort to "copy-paste" pattern. (2) One-shot inference cannot iteratively correct missing attributes or poor prompt adherence. (3) Multi-agents rely on non-robust evaluators, ill-suited for assessing stylized, non-realistic animation. To address these, we propose AnimeAgent, the first Image-to-Video (I2V)-based multi-agent framework for CSG. Inspired by Disney's "Combination of Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose" workflow, AnimeAgent leverages I2V's implicit motion prior to enhance consistency and expressiveness, while a mixed subjective-objective reviewer enables reliable iterative refinement. We also collect a human-annotated CSG benchmark with ground-truth. Experiments show AnimeAgent achieves SOTA performance in consistency, prompt fidelity, and stylization.</p></details> | Tech Report |
| **[Vision-Language Models for Ergonomic Assessment of Manual Lifting Tasks: Estimating Horizontal and Vertical Hand Distances from RGB Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20658v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual lifting tasks are a major contributor to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and effective ergonomic risk assessment is essential for quantifying physical exposure and informing ergonomic interventions. The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAGNet: Grounding 3D Affordance from Human-Object Interactions in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20608v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object affordance grounding aims to identify regions on 3D objects that support human-object interaction (HOI), a capability essential to embodied visual reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely on static visual or textual cues, neglecting that affordances are inherently defined by dynamic actions. As a result, they often struggle to localize the true contact regions involved in real interactions. We take a different perspective. Humans learn how to use objects by observing and imitating actions, not just by examining shapes. Motivated by this intuition, we introduce video-guided 3D affordance grounding, which leverages dynamic interaction sequences to provide functional supervision. To achieve this, we propose VAGNet, a framework that aligns video-derived interaction cues with 3D structure to resolve ambiguities that static cues cannot address. To support this new setting, we introduce PVAD, the first HOI video-3D pairing affordance dataset, providing functional supervision unavailable in prior works. Extensive experiments on PVAD show that VAGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming static-based baselines. The code and dataset will be open publicly.</p></details> |  |

However, training such models requires large-scale, paired (source and edited) video datasets, which are costly and complex to acquire. Hence, we propose the PropFly, a training pipeline for Propagation-based video editing, relying on on-the-Fly supervision from pre-trained video diffusion models (VDMs) instead of requiring off-the-shelf or precomputed paired video editing datasets. Specifically, our PropFly leverages one-step clean latent estimations from intermediate noised latents with varying Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scales to synthesize diverse pairs of 'source' (low-CFG) and 'edited' (high-CFG) latents on-the-fly. The source latent serves as structural information of the video, while the edited latent provides the target transformation for learning propagation. Our pipeline enables an additional adapter attached to the pre-trained VDM to learn to propagate edits via Guidance-Modulated Flow Matching (GMFM) loss, which guides the model to replicate the target transformation. Our on-the-fly supervision ensures the model to learn temporally consistent and dynamic transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PropFly significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various video editing tasks, producing high-quality editing results.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work (equal contribution)</p></details> |
| **[WildGHand: Learning Anti-Perturbation Gaussian Hand Avatars from Monocular In-the-Wild Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20556v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in 3D hand reconstruction from monocular videos, most existing methods rely on data captured in well-controlled environments and therefore degrade in real-world settings with severe perturbations, such as hand-object interactions, extreme poses, illumination changes, and motion blur. To tackle these issues, we introduce WildGHand, an optimization-based framework that enables self-adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting on in-the-wild videos and produces high-fidelity hand avatars. WildGHand incorporates two key components: (i) a dynamic perturbation disentanglement module that explicitly represents perturbations as time-varying biases on 3D Gaussian attributes during optimization, and (ii) a perturbation-aware optimization strategy that generates per-frame anisotropic weighted masks to guide optimization. Together, these components allow the framework to identify and suppress perturbations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further curate a dataset of monocular hand videos captured under diverse perturbations to benchmark in-the-wild hand avatar reconstruction. Extensive experiments on this dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that WildGHand achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantially improves over its base model across multiple metrics (e.g., up to a $15.8\%$ relative gain in PSNR and a $23.1\%$ relative reduction in LPIPS). Our implementation and dataset are available at https://github.com/XuanHuang0/WildGHand.</p></details> |  |
| **[3DSPA: A 3D Semantic Point Autoencoder for Evaluating Video Realism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20354v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI video generation is evolving rapidly. For video generators to be useful for applications ranging from robotics to film-making, they must consistently produce realistic videos. However, evaluating the realism of generated videos remains a largely manual process -- requiring human annotation or bespoke evaluation datasets which have restricted scope. Here we develop an automated evaluation framework for video realism which captures both semantics and coherent 3D structure and which does not require access to a reference video. Our method, 3DSPA, is a 3D spatiotemporal point autoencoder which integrates 3D point trajectories, depth cues, and DINO semantic features into a unified representation for video evaluation. 3DSPA models how objects move and what is happening in the scene, enabling robust assessments of realism, temporal consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments show that 3DSPA reliably identifies videos which violate physical laws, is more sensitive to motion artifacts, and aligns more closely with human judgments of video quality and realism across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that enriching trajectory-based representations with 3D semantics offers a stronger foundation for benchmarking generative video models, and implicitly captures physical rule violations. The code and pretrained model weights will be available at https://github.com/TheProParadox/3dspa_code.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Very Big Video Reasoning Suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20159v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning.

While vision-language models (VLMs) and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes, they often lack the physical grounding necessary for real-world execution. We introduce NovaPlan, a hierarchical framework that unifies closed-loop VLM and video planning with geometrically grounded robot execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation. At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NovaPlan on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). Our results show that NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

This study introduces PedaCo-Gen, a pedagogically-informed human-AI collaborative video generating system for authoring instructional videos based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.</p></details> |  |

When sensing is limited to external cameras, the problem is further compounded by perception noise and the absence of direct force or state measurements. We present Vid2Sid, a video-driven system identification pipeline that couples foundation-model perception with a VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired sim-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales. We evaluate our approach on a tendon-actuated finger (rigid-body dynamics in MuJoCo) and a deformable continuum tentacle (soft-body dynamics in PyElastica). On sim2real holdout controls unseen during training, Vid2Sid achieves the best average rank across all settings, matching or exceeding black-box optimizers while uniquely providing interpretable reasoning at each iteration. Sim2sim validation confirms that Vid2Sid recovers ground-truth parameters most accurately (mean relative error under 13\% vs. 28--98\%), and ablation analysis reveals three calibration regimes. VLM-guided optimization excels when perception is clean and the simulator is expressive, while model-class limitations bound performance in more challenging settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting.

However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also refer the reviewers to the video demo contained in the supplementary material for video results. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/UniE2F.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-to-Robot Interaction: Learning from Video Demonstration for Robot Imitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19184v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration (LfD) offers a promising paradigm for robot skill acquisition. Recent approaches attempt to extract manipulation commands directly from video demonstrations, yet face two critical challenges: (1) general video captioning models prioritize global scene features over task-relevant objects, producing descriptions unsuitable for precise robotic execution, and (2) end-to-end architectures coupling visual understanding with policy learning require extensive paired datasets and struggle to generalize across objects and scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel ``Human-to-Robot'' imitation learning pipeline that enables robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from unstructured video demonstrations, inspired by the human ability to learn by watching and imitating. Our key innovation is a modular framework that decouples the learning process into two distinct stages: (1) Video Understanding, which combines Temporal Shift Modules (TSM) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract actions and identify interacted objects, and (2) Robot Imitation, which employs TD3-based deep reinforcement learning to execute the demonstrated manipulations. We validated our approach in PyBullet simulation environments with a UR5e manipulator and in a real-world experiment with a UF850 manipulator across four fundamental actions: reach, pick, move, and put. For video understanding, our method achieves 89.97% action classification accuracy and BLEU-4 scores of 0.351 on standard objects and 0.265 on novel objects, representing improvements of 76.4% and 128.4% over the best baseline, respectively. For robot manipulation, our framework achieves an average success rate of 87.5% across all actions, with 100% success on reaching tasks and up to 90% on complex pick-and-place operations.

Within this context, joint audio-video generation (JAVG) has emerged as a fundamental task that produces synchronized and semantically aligned sound and vision from textual descriptions. However, compared with advanced commercial models such as Veo3, existing open-source methods still suffer from limitations in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and alignment with human preferences. To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens. Besides, we develop an audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) method to align model outputs with human preference across quality, consistency, and synchrony dimensions. Built upon Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely with around 1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.
