| **[Neural Message-Passing on Attention Graphs for Hallucination Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24770v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content, known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 25 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Visual Hallucinations via Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24491v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HFuzzer: Testing Large Language Models for Package Hallucinations via Phrase-based Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23835v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for code generation, but they face critical security risks when applied to practical production due to package hallucinations, in which LLMs recommend non-existent packages. These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Hallucination Detection: HSAD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23580v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Self-Consistency as a Free Lunch: Reducing Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models via Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23236v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses, which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Detection of Context-Grounded Hallucinations Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22582v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment with the model's parametric knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Textual Context: Structural Graph Encoding with Adaptive Space Alignment to alleviate the hallucination of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22251v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then, the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available at https://github.com/yfangZhang/SSKG-LLM.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Library Hallucinations in LLMs: Risk Analysis Grounded in Developer Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22202v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 tables |
| **[Black-Box Hallucination Detection via Consistency Under the Uncertain Expression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21999v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use internal knowledge of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exposing Hallucinations To Suppress Them: VLMs Representation Editing With Generative Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21997v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations, persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation. Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g., achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR. Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B, Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions, our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUMINA: Detecting Hallucinations in RAG System with Context-Knowledge Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21875v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpness-Aware Minimization Can Hallucinate Minimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21818v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers -- points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated minimizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Multi-Agent System: Mitigating Hallucination Snowballing via Visual Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21789v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks based on four common MAS structures and ten base models. The source code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/ViF.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Hallucinations Bad Estimations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21473v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image support our theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/MAGICS-LAB/hallucination</p></details> |
| **[Hallucination as an Upper Bound: A New Perspective on Text-to-Image Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21257v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at GenProCC NeurIPS 2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[PerHalluEval: Persian Hallucination Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21104v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models (LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian. PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e., the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eliminating stability hallucinations in llm-based tts models via attention guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19852v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on resolving stability hallucinations (e.g., repetitive or omitted speech) in LLM-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models by improving and leveraging the attention mechanism. First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.

| **[LLM-based Agents Suffer from Hallucinations: A Survey of Taxonomy, Methods, and Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18970v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Trustworthy Lexical Simplification: Exploring Safety and Efficiency with Small LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25086v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS), particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications. Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a promising approach for safe real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety-Critical Input-Constrained Nonlinear Intercept Guidance in Multiple Engagement Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25053v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable. The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function (log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSPR: Aligning LLM Safeguards as Generalizable Safety Policy Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24418v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into numerous applications across various domains, LLMs' safety becomes a critical concern for both application developers and intended users. Currently, great efforts have been made to develop safety benchmarks with fine-grained taxonomies. However, these benchmarks' taxonomies are disparate with different safety policies. Thus, existing safeguards trained on these benchmarks are either coarse-grained to only distinguish between safe and unsafe, or constrained by the narrow risk taxonomies of a single benchmark. To leverage these fine-grained safety taxonomies across multiple safety benchmarks, in this paper, we propose GSPR, a Generalizable Safety Policy Reasoner to identify unsafe input prompts and LLMs' outputs with violated safety taxonomies through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior safeguards which only cover a fixed set of risk factors, our GSPR incentivizes its reasoning capability with varied safety taxonomies through our careful cold-start strategy and reward design. Consequently, our GSPR can be trained across multiple safety benchmarks with distinct taxonomies and naturally exhibits powerful generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our GSPR significantly improves existing safety guardrails' reasoning capabilities for both safety and category prediction tasks. Moreover, our GSPR not only demonstrates powerful safety generalization abilities but also achieves the least inference token costs with explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Roundabout Safety Perceptions under Heterogeneous Traffic: Socio-Demographic and Geometric Influences in Indian Urban Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24397v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluation of the safety perceptions of roundabout users is crucial for improving road safety in mixed-traffic environments. The crash- and conflict-based analyses do not incorporate the socio-demographic characteristics of the roundabout users, which can only be captured through questionnaire surveys on a larger scale. This research evaluated the relationship of roundabout safety perception with demographic factors, driving characteristics, and varying roundabout geometries using multiple correspondence analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis, and multinomial logistic regression. The study analyzed data from 1,530 respondents across two Indian cities. The study identified three roundabout user clusters. Single-lane roundabouts were perceived as safer during entry and circulation, with a significant prominence among middle-aged users. In contrast, double- and multi-lane roundabouts presented higher perceived risks during exit maneuvers, especially among young, inexperienced, unemployed/self-employed users. Vulnerable road users reported significantly higher perceived risks, especially under suboptimal lighting conditions. Respondents with 10-20 years of driving experience, especially car users, perceived lower risk at single-lane roundabouts but acknowledged the higher risk linked to speed variations and complex maneuvers at multi-lane roundabouts. Driving experience, vehicle type, and geometric configurations were crucial in roundabout safety perception. The study highlighted the need to improve the built environment of roundabouts for vulnerable road users. The roundabout merging area was perceived as the most dangerous spot; however, exits were also perceived as dangerous for double- and multi-lane roundabouts.

These statements purport to establish risk thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI 'Preparedness Framework Version 2' (April 2025) using the Mechanisms & Conditions model of affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of systems with 'Medium' capabilities for what OpenAI itself defines as 'severe harm' (potential for >1000 deaths or >$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus what they claim.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[DiffuGuard: How Intrinsic Safety is Lost and Found in Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24296v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias, while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/niez233/DiffuGuard.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdvChain: Adversarial Chain-of-Thought Tuning for Robust Safety Alignment of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24269v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDC-Based Model Predictive Control: Enhancing Computational Feasibility for Safety-Critical Quadrotor Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24208v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is widely used for controlling high-speed robotic systems such as quadrotors. However, its significant computational demands often hinder real-time feasibility and reliability, particularly in environments requiring robust obstacle avoidance. This paper proposes a novel SDC-Based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which preserves the high-precision performance of NMPC while substantially reducing computational complexity by over 30%. By reformulating the nonlinear quadrotor dynamics through the State-Dependent Coefficient (SDC) method, the original nonlinear program problem is transformed into a sequential quadratic optimization problem. The controller integrates an integral action to eliminate steady-state tracking errors and imposes constraints for safety-critical obstacle avoidance. Additionally, a disturbance estimator is incorporated to enhance robustness against external perturbations. Simulation results demonstrate that the SDC-Based MPC achieves comparable tracking accuracy to NMPC, with greater efficiency in terms of computation times, thereby improving its suitability for real-time applications. Theoretical analysis further establishes the stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the initial version</p></details> |
| **[Open Opportunities in AI Safety, Alignment, and Ethics (AI SAE)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24065v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI safety research has emphasized interpretability, control, and robustness, yet without an ethical substrate these approaches may remain fragile under competitive and open-ended pressures. This paper explores ethics not as an external add-on, but as a possible structural lens for alignment, introducing a \emph{moral problem space} $M$: a high-dimensional domain in which moral distinctions could, in principle, be represented in AI systems. Human moral reasoning is treated as a compressed and survival-biased projection $\tilde{M}$, clarifying why judgment is inconsistent while suggesting tentative methods -- such as sparse autoencoders, causal mediation, and cross-cultural corpora -- that might help probe for disentangled moral features. Within this framing, metaethical positions are interpreted as research directions: realism as the search for stable invariants, relativism as context-dependent distortions, constructivism as institutional shaping of persistence, and virtue ethics as dispositional safeguards under distributional shift. Evolutionary dynamics and institutional design are considered as forces that may determine whether ethical-symbiotic lineages remain competitively viable against more autarkic trajectories. Rather than offering solutions, the paper sketches a research agenda in which embedding ethics directly into representational substrates could serve to make philosophical claims more empirically approachable, positioning moral theory as a potential source of hypotheses for alignment work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Falcon: A Cross-Modal Evaluation Dataset for Comprehensive Safety Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23783v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth. This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeSearch: Automated Red-Teaming for the Safety of LLM-Based Search Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23694v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[HomeSafeBench: A Benchmark for Embodied Vision-Language Models in Free-Exploration Home Safety Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23690v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards: fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room, HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs. The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable reference and support for future research related to home security inspections. Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encoding Material Safety using Control Barrier Functions for Soft Actuator Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23623v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion, often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology can enforce the material safety specification.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[PSG-Agent: Personality-Aware Safety Guardrail for LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23614v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents. First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries, generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second, PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward personalized safety for LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A2D: Any-Order, Any-Step Safety Alignment for Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23286v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://ai-isl.github.io/A2D</p></details> |

This paper examines the ulterior function of these technologies as mechanisms of legal influence. First, we examine how encryption, federated learning, and synthetic data -- presented as enhancing privacy and reducing bias -- can operate as mechanisms of avoidance with existing regulations in attempts to place data operations outside the scope of traditional regulatory frameworks. Second, we investigate how emerging AI safety practices including open-source model releases, evaluations, and alignment techniques can be used as mechanisms of change that direct regulatory focus towards industry-controlled voluntary standards and self-governance. We term this phenomenon anti-regulatory AI -- the deployment of ostensibly protective technologies that simultaneously shapes the terms of regulatory oversight. Our analysis additionally reveals how technologies' anti-regulatory functions are enabled through framing that legitimizes their deployment while obscuring their use as regulatory workarounds. This paper closes with a discussion of policy implications that centers on the consideration of business incentives that drive AI development and the role of technical expertise in assessing whether these technologies fulfill their purported protections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming at EAAMO 2025</p></details> |
| **[Teleoperator-Aware and Safety-Critical Adaptive Nonlinear MPC for Shared Autonomy in Obstacle Avoidance of Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22815v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz) enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework, demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Safety Gap: Surgical Concept Erasure in Visual Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22400v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation by earlier methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety Compliance: Rethinking LLM Safety Reasoning through the Lens of Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22250v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However, existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.</p></details> |  |
