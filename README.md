| **[Align to Structure: Aligning Large Language Models with Structural Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03622v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating long, coherent text remains a challenge for large language models (LLMs), as they lack hierarchical planning and structured organization in discourse generation. We introduce Structural Alignment, a novel method that aligns LLMs with human-like discourse structures to enhance long-form text generation. By integrating linguistically grounded discourse frameworks into reinforcement learning, our approach guides models to produce coherent and well-organized outputs. We employ a dense reward scheme within a Proximal Policy Optimization framework, assigning fine-grained, token-level rewards based on the discourse distinctiveness relative to human writing. Two complementary reward models are evaluated: the first improves readability by scoring surface-level textual features to provide explicit structuring, while the second reinforces deeper coherence and rhetorical sophistication by analyzing global discourse patterns through hierarchical discourse motifs, outperforming both standard and RLHF-enhanced models in tasks such as essay generation and long-document summarization. All training data and code will be publicly shared at https://github.com/minnesotanlp/struct_align.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review. 42 pages</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Rectification Sampling for Test-Time Compute Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01317v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chain of thoughts (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicate that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01005v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[GenPRM: Scaling Test-Time Compute of Process Reward Models via Generative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00891v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that it is promising to utilize Process Reward Models (PRMs) as verifiers to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, current PRMs face three key challenges: (1) limited process supervision and generalization capabilities, (2) dependence on scalar value prediction without leveraging the generative abilities of LLMs, and (3) inability to scale the test-time compute of PRMs. In this work, we introduce GenPRM, a generative process reward model that performs explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with code verification before providing judgment for each reasoning step. To obtain high-quality process supervision labels and rationale data, we propose Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and a rationale synthesis framework that incorporates code verification. Experimental results on ProcessBench and several mathematical reasoning tasks show that GenPRM significantly outperforms prior PRMs with only 23K training data from MATH dataset. Through test-time scaling, a 1.5B GenPRM outperforms GPT-4o, and a 7B GenPRM surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench. Additionally, GenPRM demonstrates strong abilities to serve as a critic model for policy model refinement. This work establishes a new paradigm for process supervision that bridges the gap between PRMs and critic models in LLMs. Our code, model, and data will be available in https://ryanliu112.github.io/GenPRM.</p></details> |  |
| **[VerifiAgent: a Unified Verification Agent in Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00406v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities but often produce unreliable or incorrect responses. Existing verification methods are typically model-specific or domain-restricted, requiring significant computational resources and lacking scalability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain. Code is available at https://github.com/Jiuzhouh/VerifiAgent</p></details> |  |

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report (In Progress); Code released at: https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Bench-R1</p></details> |
| **[Crossing the Reward Bridge: Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23829v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing mathematical reasoning and coding performance of large language models (LLMs), especially when structured reference answers are accessible for verification. However, its extension to broader, less structured domains remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness and scalability of RLVR across diverse real-world domains including medicine, chemistry, psychology, economics, and education, where structured reference answers are typically unavailable. We reveal that binary verification judgments on broad-domain tasks exhibit high consistency across various LLMs provided expert-written reference answers exist. Motivated by this finding, we utilize a generative scoring technique that yields soft, model-based reward signals to overcome limitations posed by binary verifications, especially in free-form, unstructured answer scenarios. We further demonstrate the feasibility of training cross-domain generative reward models using relatively small (7B) LLMs without the need for extensive domain-specific annotation. Through comprehensive experiments, our RLVR framework establishes clear performance gains, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art open-source aligned models such as Qwen2.5-72B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across domains in free-form settings. Our approach notably enhances the robustness, flexibility, and scalability of RLVR, representing a substantial step towards practical reinforcement learning applications in complex, noisy-label scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thinking Longer, Not Larger: Enhancing Software Engineering Agents via Scaling Test-Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23803v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in software engineering agents have demonstrated promising capabilities in automating program improvements. However, their reliance on closed-source or resource-intensive models introduces significant deployment challenges in private environments, prompting a critical question: \textit{How can personally deployable open-source LLMs achieve comparable code reasoning performance?} To this end, we propose a unified Test-Time Compute scaling framework that leverages increased inference-time computation instead of larger models. Our framework incorporates two complementary strategies: internal TTC and external TTC. Internally, we introduce a \textit{development-contextualized trajectory synthesis} method leveraging real-world software repositories to bootstrap multi-stage reasoning processes, such as fault localization and patch generation. We further enhance trajectory quality through rejection sampling, rigorously evaluating trajectories along accuracy and complexity. Externally, we propose a novel \textit{development-process-based search} strategy guided by reward models and execution verification. This approach enables targeted computational allocation at critical development decision points, overcoming limitations of existing "end-point only" verification methods. Evaluations on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate our \textbf{32B model achieves a 46\% issue resolution rate}, surpassing significantly larger models such as DeepSeek R1 671B and OpenAI o1. Additionally, we provide the empirical validation of the test-time scaling phenomenon within SWE agents, revealing that \textbf{models dynamically allocate more tokens to increasingly challenging problems}, effectively enhancing reasoning capabilities. We publicly release all training data, models, and code to facilitate future research. https://github.com/yingweima2022/SWE-Reasoner</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model: A Natural Generalization of Bradley-Terry Reward Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22480v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a critical technique for training large language models. However, reward hacking-a phenomenon where models exploit flaws in the reward model-remains a significant barrier to achieving robust and scalable intelligence through long-term training. Existing studies have proposed uncertain reward model to address reward hacking, however, they often lack systematic or theoretical foundations, failing to model the uncertainty intrinsically emerging from preference data, thus cannot sufficiently mitigate reward hacking to sustain prolonged RLHF training and exploration. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Uncertain Reward Model (PURM), a natural generalization of the classical Bradley-Terry reward model, that directly model the reward distribution emerged from the preference data. We theoretically derived PURM's loss function and the reward distribution uncertainty calculation based on Bhattacharyya Coefficient. To mitigate reward hacking with PURM, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware penalty into Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which leverages the learned uncertainty to dynamically balance reward optimization and exploration. We propose a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of PURM. Experiments demonstrate that PURM significantly delays the onset of reward hacking while improving final reward performance, outperforming baseline methods in both stability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process Reward Modeling with Entropy-Driven Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22233v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Entropy-Driven Unified Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel framework that approximates state-of-the-art performance in process supervision while drastically reducing training costs. EDU-PRM introduces an entropy-guided dynamic step partitioning mechanism, using logit distribution entropy to pinpoint high-uncertainty regions during token generation dynamically. This self-assessment capability enables precise step-level feedback without manual fine-grained annotation, addressing a critical challenge in process supervision. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-72B model with only 7,500 EDU-PRM-generated training queries demonstrate accuracy closely approximating the full Qwen2.5-72B-PRM (71.1% vs. 71.6%), achieving a 98% reduction in query cost compared to prior methods. This work establishes EDU-PRM as an efficient approach for scalable process reward model training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Data Scaling Trends and Effects in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22230v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning large language models with human preferences. While recent research has focused on algorithmic improvements, the importance of prompt-data construction has been overlooked. This paper addresses this gap by exploring data-driven bottlenecks in RLHF performance scaling, particularly reward hacking and decreasing response diversity. We introduce a hybrid reward system combining reasoning task verifiers (RTV) and a generative reward model (GenRM) to mitigate reward hacking. We also propose a novel prompt-selection method, Pre-PPO, to maintain response diversity and enhance learning effectiveness. Additionally, we find that prioritizing mathematical and coding tasks early in RLHF training significantly improves performance. Experiments across two model sizes validate our methods' effectiveness and scalability. Results show that RTV is most resistant to reward hacking, followed by GenRM with ground truth, and then GenRM with SFT Best-of-N responses. Our strategies enable rapid capture of subtle task-specific distinctions, leading to substantial improvements in overall RLHF performance. This work highlights the importance of careful data construction and provides practical methods to overcome performance barriers in RLHF.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel system deployed at Alibaba that leverages AI-generated items (AIGI) to address these challenges with personalized text-to-image generation for e-commercial product design. AIGI enables an innovative business mode called "sell it before you make it", where merchants can design fashion items and generate photorealistic images with digital models based on textual descriptions. Only when the items have received a certain number of orders, do the merchants start to produce them, which largely reduces reliance on physical prototypes and thus accelerates time to market. For such a promising application, we identify the underlying key scientific challenge, i.e., capturing the users' group-level personalized preferences towards multiple generated candidate images. To this end, we propose a Personalized Group-Level Preference Alignment Framework for Diffusion Models (i.e., PerFusion). We first design PerFusion Reward Model for user preference estimation with a feature-crossing-based personalized plug-in. Then we develop PerFusion with a personalized adaptive network to model diverse preferences across users, and meanwhile derive the group-level preference optimization objective to capture the comparative behaviors among multiple candidates. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The AI-generated items have achieved over 13% relative improvements for both click-through rate and conversion rate compared to their human-designed counterparts, validating the revolutionary potential of AI-generated items for e-commercial platforms.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Is Best-of-N the Best of Them? Coverage, Scaling, and Optimality in Inference-Time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21878v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time computation provides an important axis for scaling language model performance, but naively scaling compute through techniques like Best-of-$N$ sampling can cause performance to degrade due to reward hacking. Toward a theoretical understanding of how to best leverage additional computation, we focus on inference-time alignment which we formalize as the problem of improving a pre-trained policy's responses for a prompt of interest, given access to an imperfect reward model. We analyze the performance of inference-time alignment algorithms in terms of (i) response quality, and (ii) compute, and provide new results that highlight the importance of the pre-trained policy's coverage over high-quality responses for performance and compute scaling: 1. We show that Best-of-$N$ alignment with an ideal choice for $N$ can achieve optimal performance under stringent notions of coverage, but provably suffers from reward hacking when $N$ is large, and fails to achieve tight guarantees under more realistic coverage conditions. 2. We introduce $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$, a new algorithm which mitigates reward hacking through deliberate use of inference-time compute, implementing the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via rejection sampling; we prove that its performance is optimal and does not degrade with $N$, meaning it is scaling-monotonic. We complement our theoretical results with an experimental evaluation that demonstrate the benefits of $\texttt{InferenceTimePessimism}$ across a variety of tasks and models.</p></details> |  |
| **[R-PRM: Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21295v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) inevitably make mistakes when performing step-by-step mathematical reasoning. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising solution by evaluating each reasoning step. However, existing PRMs typically output evaluation scores directly, limiting both learning efficiency and evaluation accuracy, which is further exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated data. To address these issues, we propose Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling (R-PRM). First, we leverage stronger LLMs to generate seed data from limited annotations, effectively bootstrapping our model's reasoning capabilities and enabling comprehensive step-by-step evaluation. Second, we further enhance performance through preference optimization, without requiring additional annotated data. Third, we introduce inference-time scaling to fully harness the model's reasoning potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate R-PRM's effectiveness: on ProcessBench and PRMBench, it surpasses strong baselines by 11.9 and 8.5 points in F1 scores, respectively. When applied to guide mathematical reasoning, R-PRM achieves consistent accuracy improvements of over 8.5 points across six challenging datasets. Further analysis reveals that R-PRM exhibits more comprehensive evaluation and stronger generalization capabilities, thereby highlighting its significant potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/R-PRM</p></details> |
| **[Multi-head Reward Aggregation Guided by Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20995v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with safety guidelines typically involves reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), relying on human-generated preference annotations. However, assigning consistent overall quality ratings is challenging, prompting recent research to shift towards detailed evaluations based on multiple specific safety criteria. This paper uncovers a consistent observation: safety rules characterized by high rating entropy are generally less reliable in identifying responses preferred by humans. Leveraging this finding, we introduce ENCORE, a straightforward entropy-guided approach that composes multi-head rewards by downweighting rules exhibiting high rating entropy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that rules with elevated entropy naturally receive minimal weighting in the Bradley-Terry optimization framework, justifying our entropy-based penalization. Through extensive experiments on RewardBench safety tasks, our method significantly surpasses several competitive baselines, including random weighting, uniform weighting, single-head Bradley-Terry models, and LLM-based judging methods. Our proposed approach is training-free, broadly applicable to various datasets, and maintains interpretability, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-attribute reward modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLBench: A Suite for Vision-Language Process Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20271v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-supervised reward models serve as a fine-grained function that provides detailed step-wise feedback to model responses, facilitating effective selection of reasoning trajectories for complex tasks. Despite its advantages, evaluation on PRMs remains less explored, especially in the multimodal domain. To address this gap, this paper first benchmarks current vision large language models (VLLMs) as two types of reward models: output reward models (ORMs) and process reward models (PRMs) on multiple vision-language benchmarks, which reveal that neither ORM nor PRM consistently outperforms across all tasks, and superior VLLMs do not necessarily yield better rewarding performance. To further advance evaluation, we introduce ViLBench, a vision-language benchmark designed to require intensive process reward signals. Notably, OpenAI's GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) achieves only 27.3% accuracy, indicating the benchmark's challenge for current VLLMs. Lastly, we preliminarily showcase a promising pathway towards bridging the gap between general VLLMs and reward models -- by collecting 73.6K vision-language process reward data using an enhanced tree-search algorithm, our 3B model is able to achieve an average improvement of 3.3% over standard CoT and up to 2.5% compared to its untrained counterpart on ViLBench by selecting OpenAI o1's generations. We release the implementations at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/ViLBench with our code, model, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Safe and Aligned Language Generation: A Multi-Objective GRPO Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21819v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and safety constraints is challenging, especially when objectives like helpfulness, truthfulness, and avoidance of harm conflict. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved notable success in steering models, but is complex and can be unstable. Recent approaches such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplify preference-based fine-tuning but may introduce bias or trade-off certain objectives~\cite{dpo}. In this work, we propose a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework with a multi-label reward regression model to achieve safe and aligned language generation. The GRPO algorithm optimizes a policy by comparing groups of sampled responses, eliminating the need for a separate value critic and improving training efficiency~\cite{grpo}. We train a reward model to predict multiple alignment scores (e.g., safety, helpfulness, etc.), which are combined into a single reward signal. We provide a theoretical derivation for using this learned multi-aspect reward within GRPO and discuss its advantages and limitations. Empirically, our approach improves all the safety and quality metrics evaluated in language generation tasks on model scales (0.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters), demonstrating a robust balance of objectives. We compare GRPO to PPO-based RLHF and DPO, highlighting that GRPO achieves alignment with significantly lower computational cost and explicit multi-objective handling. \textbf{We will open-source all trained models at https://huggingface.co/hydroxai.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAPO: Learning Preferential Prompt through Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20194v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have highlighted the critical need for precise control over model outputs through predefined constraints. While existing methods attempt to achieve this through either direct instruction-response synthesis or preferential response optimization, they often struggle with constraint understanding and adaptation. This limitation becomes particularly evident when handling fine-grained constraints, leading to either hallucination or brittle performance. We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO. Our results suggest that GAPO's unique approach to preferential prompt learning offers a more robust and effective solution for controlling LLM outputs. Code is avaliable in https://github.com/MikeGu721/GAPO.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) excel in many reasoning tasks, their ability to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for text-to-SQL remains underexplored. We identify critical limitations: zero-shot CoT offers minimal gains, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied without CoT yields marginal improvements. We propose ExCoT, a novel framework that iteratively optimizes open-source LLMs by combining CoT reasoning with off-policy and on-policy DPO, relying solely on execution accuracy as feedback. This approach eliminates the need for reward models or human-annotated preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains: ExCoT improves execution accuracy on BIRD dev set from 57.37% to 68.51% and on Spider test set from 78.81% to 86.59% for LLaMA-3 70B, with Qwen-2.5-Coder demonstrating similar improvements. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single-model setting on both BIRD and Spider datasets, notably achieving 68.53% on the BIRD test set.</p></details> |  |

Black-box models demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.</p></details> | 9 pages, preprint |
| **[Do Larger Language Models Imply Better Reasoning? A Pretraining Scaling Law for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03635v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks requiring complex reasoning. However, the effects of scaling on their reasoning abilities remain insufficiently understood. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic multihop reasoning environment designed to closely replicate the structure and distribution of real-world large-scale knowledge graphs. Our reasoning task involves completing missing edges in the graph, which requires advanced multi-hop reasoning and mimics real-world reasoning scenarios. To evaluate this, we pretrain language models (LMs) from scratch solely on triples from the incomplete graph and assess their ability to infer the missing edges. Interestingly, we observe that overparameterization can impair reasoning performance due to excessive memorization. We investigate different factors that affect this U-shaped loss curve, including graph structure, model size, and training steps. To predict the optimal model size for a specific knowledge graph, we find an empirical scaling that linearly maps the knowledge graph search entropy to the optimal model size. This work provides new insights into the relationship between scaling and reasoning in LLMs, shedding light on possible ways to optimize their performance for reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Difficulty Filtering for Reasoning Oriented Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03380v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-Oriented Reinforcement Learning (RORL) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, due to the sparsity of rewards in RORL, effective training is highly dependent on the selection of problems of appropriate difficulty. Although curriculum learning attempts to address this by adjusting difficulty, it often relies on static schedules, and even recent online filtering methods lack theoretical grounding and a systematic understanding of their effectiveness. In this work, we theoretically and empirically show that curating the batch with the problems that the training model achieves intermediate accuracy on the fly can maximize the effectiveness of RORL training, namely balanced online difficulty filtering. We first derive that the lower bound of the KL divergence between the initial and the optimal policy can be expressed with the variance of the sampled accuracy. Building on those insights, we show that balanced filtering can maximize the lower bound, leading to better performance. Experimental results across five challenging math reasoning benchmarks show that balanced online filtering yields an additional 10% in AIME and 4% improvements in average over plain GRPO. Moreover, further analysis shows the gains in sample efficiency and training time efficiency, exceeding the maximum reward of plain GRPO within 60% training time and the volume of the training set.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuScenes-SpatialQA: A Spatial Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03164v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous driving tasks. However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Reasoning Matters? A Survey of Advancements in Multimodal Reasoning (v1)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03151v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is central to human intelligence, enabling structured problem-solving across diverse tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their reasoning abilities in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains. However, effectively extending these capabilities into multimodal contexts-where models must integrate both visual and textual inputs-continues to be a significant challenge. Multimodal reasoning introduces complexities, such as handling conflicting information across modalities, which require models to adopt advanced interpretative strategies. Addressing these challenges involves not only sophisticated algorithms but also robust methodologies for evaluating reasoning accuracy and coherence. This paper offers a concise yet insightful overview of reasoning techniques in both textual and multimodal LLMs. Through a thorough and up-to-date comparison, we clearly formulate core reasoning challenges and opportunities, highlighting practical methods for post-training optimization and test-time inference. Our work provides valuable insights and guidance, bridging theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, and sets clear directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightPROF: A Lightweight Reasoning Framework for Large Language Model on Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03137v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities in text understanding and zero-shot reasoning. However, delays in knowledge updates may cause them to reason incorrectly or produce harmful results. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide rich and reliable contextual information for the reasoning process of LLMs by structurally organizing and connecting a wide range of entities and relations. Existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only inject KGs' knowledge into prompts in a textual form, ignoring its structural information. Moreover, they mostly rely on close-source models or open-source models with large parameters, which poses challenges to high resource consumption. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight and efficient Prompt learning-ReasOning Framework for KGQA (LightPROF), which leverages the full potential of LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, LightPROF follows a "Retrieve-Embed-Reason process", first accurately, and stably retrieving the corresponding reasoning graph from the KG through retrieval module. Next, through a Transformer-based Knowledge Adapter, it finely extracts and integrates factual and structural information from the KG, then maps this information to the LLM's token embedding space, creating an LLM-friendly prompt to be used by the LLM for the final reasoning. Additionally, LightPROF only requires training Knowledge Adapter and can be compatible with any open-source LLM. Extensive experiments on two public KGQA benchmarks demonstrate that LightPROF achieves superior performance with small-scale LLMs. Furthermore, LightPROF shows significant advantages in terms of input token count and reasoning time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Localized Definitions and Distributed Reasoning: A Proof-of-Concept Mechanistic Interpretability Study via Activation Patching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02976v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in fine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching (CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct answer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Envisioning Beyond the Pixels: Benchmarking Reasoning-Informed Visual Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02826v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To address this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort, RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 1 table. Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[Generative Evaluation of Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02810v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing alignment methods often struggle to cover diverse safety scenarios and remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference Optimization (ERPO), a novel safety alignment framework that equips LLMs with explicit preemptive reasoning through Chain-of-Thought and provides clear evidence for safety judgments by embedding predefined safety rules. Specifically, our approach consists of three stages: first, equipping the model with Ex-Ante reasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a constructed reasoning module; second, enhancing safety, usefulness, and efficiency via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); and third, mitigating inference latency with a length-controlled iterative preference optimization strategy. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs demonstrate that ERPO significantly enhances safety performance while maintaining response efficiency.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

This could revolutionize applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and scientific simulation. However, before treating these models as world models, we must ask: Do they adhere to physical conservation laws? To answer this, we introduce Morpheus, a benchmark for evaluating video generation models on physical reasoning. It features 80 real-world videos capturing physical phenomena, guided by conservation laws. Since artificial generations lack ground truth, we assess physical plausibility using physics-informed metrics evaluated with respect to infallible conservation laws known per physical setting, leveraging advances in physics-informed neural networks and vision-language foundation models. Our findings reveal that even with advanced prompting and video conditioning, current models struggle to encode physical principles despite generating aesthetically pleasing videos. All data, leaderboard, and code are open-sourced at our project page.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM for Complex Reasoning Task: An Exploratory Study in Fermi Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02671v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fermi Problems (FPs) are mathematical reasoning tasks that require human-like logic and numerical reasoning. Unlike other reasoning questions, FPs often involve real-world impracticalities or ambiguous concepts, making them challenging even for humans to solve. Despite advancements in AI, particularly with large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, FPs remain relatively under-explored. This work conducted an exploratory study to examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in solving FPs. We first evaluated the overall performance of three advanced LLMs using a publicly available FP dataset. We designed prompts according to the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy, including a zero-shot scenario. Results indicated that all three LLMs achieved a fp_score (range between 0 - 1) below 0.5, underscoring the inherent difficulty of these reasoning tasks. To further investigate, we categorized FPs into standard and specific questions, hypothesizing that LLMs would perform better on standard questions, which are characterized by clarity and conciseness, than on specific ones. Comparative experiments confirmed this hypothesis, demonstrating that LLMs performed better on standard FPs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,7 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

We introduce SymDQN, a novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent. The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LexPam: Legal Procedure Awareness-Guided Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02590v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The legal mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs is crucial when applying them to real-world scenarios, as it directly affects the credibility of the LLM. While existing legal LLMs can perform general judicial question answering, their legal mathematical reasoning capabilities have not been trained. Open-domain reasoning models, though able to generate detailed calculation steps, do not follow the reasoning logic required for legal scenarios. Additionally, there is currently a lack of legal mathematical reasoning datasets to help validate and enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities in legal contexts. To address these issues, we propose the first Chinese legal Mathematical Reasoning Dataset, LexNum, which includes three common legal mathematical reasoning scenarios: economic compensation, work injury compensation, and traffic accident compensation. Based on LexNum, we tested the performance of existing legal LLMs and reasoning LLMs, and introduced LexPam, a reinforcement learning algorithm guided by legal procedural awareness to train LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities in legal scenarios. Experiments on tasks in the three legal scenarios show that the performance of existing legal LLMs and reasoning models in legal mathematical reasoning tasks is unsatisfactory. LexPam can enhance the LLM's ability in these tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Inconsistencies and How to Mitigate Them in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02577v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to significant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities. However, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our understanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited, particularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of logical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as contradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous conclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning discrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal procedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity of the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these errors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or logically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing novel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs, natural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for detecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque internal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To mitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a data efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a synthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the thesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning tasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful and interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference. Critically, this thesis provides a comprehensive framework to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of deep learning models across diverse tasks and modalities.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[GPG: A Simple and Strong Reinforcement Learning Baseline for Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02546v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. As illustrated in our paper, by eliminating both the critic and reference models, and avoiding KL divergence constraints, our approach significantly simplifies the training process when compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/GPG.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOOST: Bootstrapping Strategy-Driven Reasoning Programs for Program-Guided Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02467v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program-guided reasoning has shown promise in complex claim fact-checking by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs. However, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with ad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design with substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it challenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose BOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and information-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation, iteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and data-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CHARMS: Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02450v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the current challenges of low intelligence and simplistic vehicle behavior modeling in autonomous driving simulation scenarios, this paper proposes the Cognitive Hierarchical Agent with Reasoning and Motion Styles (CHARMS). The model can reason about the behavior of other vehicles like a human driver and respond with different decision-making styles, thereby improving the intelligence and diversity of the surrounding vehicles in the driving scenario. By introducing the Level-k behavioral game theory, the paper models the decision-making process of human drivers and employs deep reinforcement learning to train the models with diverse decision styles, simulating different reasoning approaches and behavioral characteristics. Building on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a novel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of vehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and binomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS not only exhibits superior decision-making capabilities as ego vehicles, but also generates more complex and diverse driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. We will release code for CHARMS at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.</p></details> |  |

This requires systematic lifecycle management of AI models, ensuring their impact on services and stakeholders is continuously monitored. While current 6G initiatives introduce AI, they often fall short in addressing end-to-end intelligence and crucial aspects like trust, transparency, privacy, and verifiability. Trustworthy AI is vital, especially for critical infrastructures like 6G. This paper introduces the REASON approach for holistically addressing AI's native integration and trustworthiness in future 6G networks. The approach comprises AI Orchestration (AIO) for model lifecycle management, Cognition (COG) for performance evaluation and explanation, and AI Monitoring (AIM) for tracking and feedback. Digital Twin (DT) technology is leveraged to facilitate real-time monitoring and scenario testing, which are essential for AIO, COG, and AIM. We demonstrate this approach through an AI-enabled xAPP use case, leveraging a DT platform to validate, explain, and deploy trustworthy AI models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in anesthesiology and analyze key factors influencing their performance. To this end, we introduce AnesBench, a cross-lingual benchmark designed to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Through extensive experiments, we first explore how model characteristics, including model scale, Chain of Thought (CoT) length, and language transferability, affect reasoning performance. Then, we further evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies, leveraging our curated anesthesiology-related dataset, including continuous pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we also investigate how the test-time reasoning techniques, such as Best-of-N sampling and beam search, influence reasoning performance, and assess the impact of reasoning-enhanced model distillation, specifically DeepSeek-R1. We will publicly release AnesBench, along with our CPT and SFT training datasets and evaluation code at https://github.com/MiliLab/AnesBench.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |
