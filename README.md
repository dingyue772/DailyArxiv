| **[OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04804v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |

First, we construct a comprehensive training corpus comprising 148k samples spanning these three modalities. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage paradigm to incentivize the model to deliberate before making decisions: (1) conducting SFT to cold-start the model with explicit reasoning capabilities and structural adherence; and (2) performing RL, incorporating an error-driven exploration reward to incentivize deeper reasoning on hard samples. We release a suite of models scaled at 2B and 4B parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GuardReasoner-Omni achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines across various guardrail benchmarks. Notably, GuardReasoner-Omni (2B) significantly surpasses the runner-up by 5.3% F1 score.</p></details> |  |
| **[vLLM-Omni: Fully Disaggregated Serving for Any-to-Any Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any-to-any multimodal models that jointly handle text, images, video, and audio represent a significant advance in multimodal AI. However, their complex architectures (typically combining multiple autoregressive LLMs, diffusion transformers, and other specialized components) pose substantial challenges for efficient model serving. Existing serving systems are mainly tailored to a single paradigm, such as autoregressive LLMs for text generation or diffusion transformers for visual generation. They lack support for any-to-any pipelines that involve multiple interconnected model components. As a result, developers must manually handle cross-stage interactions, leading to huge performance degradation. We present vLLM-Omni, a fully disaggregated serving system for any-to-any models. vLLM-Omni features a novel stage abstraction that enables users to decompose complex any-to-any architectures into interconnected stages represented as a graph, and a disaggregated stage execution backend that optimizes resource utilization and throughput across stages. Each stage is independently served by an LLM or diffusion engine with per-stage request batching, flexible GPU allocation, and unified inter-stage connectors for data routing. Experimental results demonstrate that vLLM-Omni reduces job completion time (JCT) by up to 91.4% compared to baseline methods. The code is public available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Omni-Judge: Can Omni-LLMs Serve as Human-Aligned Judges for Text-Conditioned Audio-Video Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01623v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video generation models such as Sora 2 and Veo 3 can now produce high-fidelity videos with synchronized audio directly from a textual prompt, marking a new milestone in multi-modal generation. However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-RRM: Advancing Omni Reward Modeling via Automatic Rubric-Grounded Preference Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00846v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet their performance is often capped by the coarse nature of existing alignment techniques. A critical bottleneck remains the lack of effective reward models (RMs): existing RMs are predominantly vision-centric, return opaque scalar scores, and rely on costly human annotations. We introduce \textbf{Omni-RRM}, the first open-source rubric-grounded reward model that produces structured, multi-dimension preference judgments with dimension-wise justifications across \textbf{text, image, video, and audio}. At the core of our approach is \textbf{Omni-Preference}, a large-scale dataset built via a fully automated pipeline: we synthesize candidate response pairs by contrasting models of different capabilities, and use strong teacher models to \emph{reconcile and filter} preferences while providing a modality-aware \emph{rubric-grounded rationale} for each pair. This eliminates the need for human-labeled training preferences. Omni-RRM is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning to learn the rubric-grounded outputs, followed by reinforcement learning (GRPO) to sharpen discrimination on difficult, low-contrast pairs. Comprehensive evaluations show that Omni-RRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on video (80.2\% on ShareGPT-V) and audio (66.8\% on Audio-HH-RLHF) benchmarks, and substantially outperforms existing open-source RMs on image tasks, with a 17.7\% absolute gain over its base model on overall accuracy. Omni-RRM also improves downstream performance via Best-of-$N$ selection and transfers to text-only preference benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Omni-RRM-CC08.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-fMRI: A Universal Atlas-Free fMRI Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23090v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised fMRI foundation models have shown promising transfer performance, yet most rely on predefined region-level parcellations that discard fine-grained voxel information and introduce atlas-dependent biases. We propose Omni-fMRI, an atlas-free foundation model that operates directly on voxel-level signals. To enable scalable pretraining on 49,497 fMRI sessions across nine datasets, Omni-fMRI introduces a dynamic patching mechanism that substantially reduces computational cost while preserving informative spatial structure. To support reproducibility and fair comparison, we establish a comprehensive benchmark suite spanning 11 datasets and a diverse set of resting-state and task-based fMRI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Omni-fMRI consistently outperforms existing foundation models, providing a scalable and reproducible framework for atlas-free brain representation learning. Code and logs are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Alignment Curse: Cross-Modality Jailbreak Transfer in Omni-Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02557v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in end-to-end trained omni-models have significantly improved multimodal understanding. At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming. We further demonstrate strong cross-model transferability and show that text-transferred audio attacks remain effective even under a stricter audio-only access threat model.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-Omni: A Unified Autoregressive Model for Any-to-Any Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17761v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world perception and interaction are inherently multimodal, encompassing not only language but also vision and speech, which motivates the development of "Omni" MLLMs that support both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs. While a sequence of omni MLLMs has emerged, most existing systems still rely on additional expert components to achieve multimodal generation, limiting the simplicity of unified training and inference. Autoregressive (AR) modeling, with a single token stream, a single next-token objective, and a single decoder, is an elegant and scalable foundation in the text domain. Motivated by this, we present AR-Omni, a unified any-to-any model in the autoregressive paradigm without any expert decoders. AR-Omni supports autoregressive text and image generation, as well as streaming speech generation, all under a single Transformer decoder. We further address three practical issues in unified AR modeling: modality imbalance via task-aware loss reweighting, visual fidelity via a lightweight token-level perceptual alignment loss for image tokens, and stability-creativity trade-offs via a finite-state decoding mechanism. Empirically, AR-Omni achieves strong quality across three modalities while remaining real-time, achieving a 0.88 real-time factor for speech generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-directional attention mechanism based on Mamba for speech separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16603v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a selective state-space model (SSM), has emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformers for speech modeling, enabling long-sequence processing with linear complexity. While effective in speech separation, existing approaches, whether in the time or time-frequency domain, typically decompose the input along a single dimension into short one-dimensional sequences before processing them with Mamba, which restricts it to local 1D modeling and limits its ability to capture global dependencies across the 2D spectrogram. In this work, we propose an efficient omni-directional attention (OA) mechanism built upon unidirectional Mamba, which models global dependencies from ten different directions on the spectrogram. We expand the proposed mechanism into two baseline separation models and evaluate on three public datasets. Experimental results show that our approach consistently achieves significant performance gains over the baselines while preserving linear complexity, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[FutureOmni: Evaluating Future Forecasting from Omni-Modal Context for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13836v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong omni-modal perception, their ability to forecast future events from audio-visual cues remains largely unexplored, as existing benchmarks focus mainly on retrospective understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni).</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://openmoss.github.io/FutureOmni</p></details> |
| **[AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10513v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROMA: Real-time Omni-Multimodal Assistant with Interactive Streaming Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10323v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project page is available at https://eureka-maggie.github.io/ROMA_show</p></details> |
| **[Omni-R1: Towards the Unified Generative Paradigm for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09536v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are making significant progress in multimodal reasoning. Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speech-Hands: A Self-Reflection Voice Agentic Approach to Speech Recognition and Audio Reasoning with Omni Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09413v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a voice-agentic framework that learns one critical omni-understanding skill: knowing when to trust itself versus when to consult external audio perception. Our work is motivated by a crucial yet counterintuitive finding: naively fine-tuning an omni-model on both speech recognition and external sound understanding tasks often degrades performance, as the model can be easily misled by noisy hypotheses. To address this, our framework, Speech-Hands, recasts the problem as an explicit self-reflection decision. This learnable reflection primitive proves effective in preventing the model from being derailed by flawed external candidates. We show that this agentic action mechanism generalizes naturally from speech recognition to complex, multiple-choice audio reasoning. Across the OpenASR leaderboard, Speech-Hands consistently outperforms strong baselines by 12.1% WER on seven benchmarks. The model also achieves 77.37% accuracy and high F1 on audio QA decisions, showing robust generalization and reliability across diverse audio question answering datasets. By unifying perception and decision-making, our work offers a practical path toward more reliable and resilient audio intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[e5-omni: Explicit Cross-modal Alignment for Omni-modal Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03666v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones. We release our model checkpoint at https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/Haon-Chen/e5-omni-7B</p></details> |
| **[HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01792v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we present HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni, the first any-to-any omnimodal model in the HyperCLOVA X family that supports text, audio, and vision as both inputs and outputs. By consolidating multimodal understanding and generation into a single model rather than separate modality-specific pipelines, HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni serves as an 8B-scale omni-pathfinding point toward practical any-to-any omni assistants. At a high level, the model unifies modalities through a shared next-token prediction interface over an interleaved multimodal sequence, while vision and audio encoders inject continuous embeddings for fine-grained understanding and grounding. Empirical evaluations demonstrate competitive performance against comparably sized models across diverse input-output combinations spanning text, audio, and vision, in both Korean and English. We anticipate that the open-weight release of HyperCLOVA X 8B Omni will support a wide range of research and deployment scenarios.</p></details> | Technical Report |

To address this gap, we present Omni-Weather, the first multimodal foundation model that unifies weather generation and understanding within a single architecture. Omni-Weather integrates a radar encoder for weather generation tasks, followed by unified processing using a shared self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset for causal reasoning in weather generation, enabling interpretable outputs and improved perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show Omni-Weather achieves state-of-the-art performance in both weather generation and understanding. Our findings further indicate that generative and understanding tasks in the weather domain can mutually enhance each other. Omni-Weather also demonstrates the feasibility and value of unifying weather generation and understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[UmniBench: Unified Understand and Generation Model Oriented Omni-dimensional Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17196v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://umnibench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SFBD-OMNI: Bridge models for lossy measurement restoration with limited clean samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17051v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MMRB2</p></details> |

| **[Context Forcing: Consistent Autoregressive Video Generation with Long Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06028v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaVF: State Space Model for Efficient Video Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06017v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video fusion is a fundamental technique in various video processing tasks. However, existing video fusion methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and feature warping, resulting in severe computational overhead and limited scalability. This paper presents MambaVF, an efficient video fusion framework based on state space models (SSMs) that performs temporal modeling without explicit motion estimation. First, by reformulating video fusion as a sequential state update process, MambaVF captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity while significantly reducing computation and memory costs. Second, MambaVF proposes a lightweight SSM-based fusion module that replaces conventional flow-guided alignment via a spatio-temporal bidirectional scanning mechanism. This module enables efficient information aggregation across frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our MambaVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical video fusion tasks. We highlight that MambaVF enjoys high efficiency, reducing up to 92.25% of parameters and 88.79% of computational FLOPs and a 2.1x speedup compared to existing methods.

To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment.

However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE IV 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Pathwise Test-Time Correction for Autoregressive Long Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05871v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weaver: End-to-End Agentic System Training for Video Interleaved Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05829v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Video Generation Propels Real-World Beyond-the-View Vision-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05827v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniSurg: A Video-Native Foundation Model for Universal Understanding of Surgical Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05638v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapeGaussian: High-Fidelity 4D Human Reconstruction in Monocular Videos via Vision Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05572v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ShapeGaussian, a high-fidelity, template-free method for 4D human reconstruction from casual monocular videos. Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction. Then, we refine this geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. By leveraging 2D vision priors, we mitigate artifacts from erroneous pose estimation in template-based methods and employ multiple reference frames to resolve the invisibility issue of 2D keypoints in a template-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior visual quality and robustness across diverse human motions in casual monocular videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastVMT: Eliminating Redundancy in Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05551v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2026, Project page: fastvmt.gitHub.io, Code: https://github.com/mayuelala/FastVMT</p></details> |
| **[DisCa: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Distillation-Compatible Learnable Feature Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05449v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures; cvpr2026 submission</p></details> |
| **[GT-SVJ: Generative-Transformer-Based Self-Supervised Video Judge For Efficient Video Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05202v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light Forcing: Accelerating Autoregressive Video Diffusion via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04789v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced autoregressive (AR) video generation models have improved visual fidelity and interactivity, but the quadratic complexity of attention remains a primary bottleneck for efficient deployment. While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SynthForensics: A Multi-Generator Benchmark for Detecting Synthetic Video Deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04939v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of synthetic media has been irrevocably altered by text-to-video (T2V) models, whose outputs are rapidly approaching indistinguishability from reality. Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review].</p></details> |  |
| **[AGILE: Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction from Video via Agentic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04672v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce the VK Large Short-Video Dataset (VK-LSVD), the largest publicly available industrial dataset of its kind. VK-LSVD offers an unprecedented scale of over 40 billion interactions from 10 million users and almost 20 million videos over six months, alongside rich features including content embeddings, diverse feedback signals, and contextual metadata. Our analysis supports the dataset's quality and diversity. The dataset's immediate impact is confirmed by its central role in the live VK RecSys Challenge 2025.

| **[Euphonium: Steering Video Flow Matching via Process Reward Gradient Guided Stochastic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04928v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-Guided Metric-Aware Temporal Consistency for Monocular Video Human Mesh Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04257v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular video human mesh recovery faces fundamental challenges in maintaining metric consistency and temporal stability due to inherent depth ambiguities and scale uncertainties. While existing methods rely primarily on RGB features and temporal smoothing, they struggle with depth ordering, scale drift, and occlusion-induced instabilities. We propose a comprehensive depth-guided framework that achieves metric-aware temporal consistency through three synergistic components: A Depth-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion module that adaptively integrates geometric priors with RGB features via confidence-aware gating; A Depth-guided Metric-Aware Pose and Shape (D-MAPS) estimator that leverages depth-calibrated bone statistics for scale-consistent initialization; A Motion-Depth Aligned Refinement (MoDAR) module that enforces temporal coherence through cross-modal attention between motion dynamics and geometric cues. Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
